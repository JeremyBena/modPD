  For the last six decades, attitude research has capitalized on evaluative conditioning procedures to gain insight into how evaluative responses are acquired. In evaluative conditioning procedure, a conditioned stimulus (or CS; e.g., an unfamiliar soda brand) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus of affective value (or US; e.g., a beautiful picture). Following this pairing, a change in CS liking may be observed (e.g., the soda brand is liked better). A question with far-reaching theoretical and practical implications is whether the change in CS liking is found in the absence of conscious retrieval of the CS-US pairing. Here, we introduce a new procedure - the two-button-sets, or TBS procedure - to examine this question in a way that overcomes limitations inherent in previous investigations. In two experiments, the TBS is (1) is successfully validated; it is also used to (2) test the "retrieval awareness" question, and (3) to examine an affect-consistent bias in memory judgments for CS-US pairings. Results from these two experiments do not support memory-independent evaluative effects, and they oppose the view that affect-consistent bias is limited to memory uncertainty. We discuss these finding in light of previous evidence and of dual-learning models of attitudes. We also discuss limitations and research avenues related to the TBS.

Over the past two decades, a wealth of evaluative conditioning studies have advanced our understanding of the role of awareness in evaluative responses. 
In evaluative conditioning studies, a change in the evaluation of a conditioned stimulus (or CS) may be observed following its pairing with an affective stimulus (or US). 
Among others, two questions were addressed in this literature: whether the conscious encoding of the CS-US pairings is necessary for an evaluative conditioning effect to be elicited, and whether the conscious retrieval of the CS-US pairings is required at the evaluation stage. 
Research generally supports the need of awareness at the encoding stage (i.e., when participants are presented with the CS-US pairings). 
For instance, when signal strength is low or when a secondary task prevents the successful encoding of the CS-US pairings, an evaluative conditioning effect is unlikely to be elicited [for a recent review, see @corneille_associative_2019]. 
However, it is still not entirely clear whether the conscious retrieval of US valence is required at the evaluation stage (i.e., when one evaluates the CS).
Whether people need conscious US retrieval as they evaluate the CSs is important for both theoretical reasons (e.g., to inform memory model or the role of memory processes in evaluative conditioning) and practical reasons (e.g., whether participants can selectively control the effects of persuasive influences on their attitudes and behaviors).

We first provide an overview and discussion of how research has addressed this *retrieval awareness* question and what conclusions were derived from two main procedures: per-item and process dissociation procedures. 
^[We use the term „retrieval awareness“ as an abbreviation of "awareness at the time of retrieval" of the learned evaluation in EC (i.e., whether participants successfully retrieved the associated US from memory at the time of CS evaluations). The term contrasts this issue from that of encoding awareness (i.e., do participants need awareness of the critical information at encoding to show an EC effect?). It thus refers to the outcome of CS-US memory retrieval; it does not imply awareness of the dynamics of the memory retrieval process itself (nor to parameters of its neuronal implementation).]
In a second step, we introduce a novel procedure that combines the advantages of the two prior procedures. 
In the empirical section, we validate the new procedure and use it to provide firmer conclusions on the retrieval awareness question. 
In doing so, we also shed additional light on the role of affect-as-information processes. 
In the general discussion, we summarize the main insights of the new procedure introduced here, and we explain how it can be used in future research for advancing attitude research.

## A short overview of research on the retrieval awareness question

Recent research has used two categories of procedures to answer whether people need to consciously retrieve CS-US pairings for EC effects to be observed. 
A first line of research relied on per-item procedures. 
A second line of research made use of a process dissociation procedure.

The per-item rationale consisted of examining if evaluative conditioning effects are found for CSs that participants prove unable to pair with the identity or the valence of their associated US in a separate memory task. 
As also true for any awareness measure, assessments of CS-US pairing memory are most informative and relevant if they meet certain criteria [@shanks_characteristics_1994].
Among those criteria is the information criterion: the requirement that assessments tap memory for those bits of information that are critical in producing the effect in question. 
The information criterion is ideally met (1) by assessments made at the level of the specific CS item (as opposed to aggregating across items and classifying participants as aware or unaware and (2) by assessing memory for US valence (rather than US identity). 
When relying on per-item procedures, researchers generally find no EC effect for CSs associated with incorrect memory reports in a separate memory task [e.g., @pleyers_aware_2007, @stahl_respective_2009]. 
In addition, memory for US valence rather than memory for US identity is critical for obtaining evaluative conditioning effects [@stahl_respective_2009]. 
More recently, however, evaluative conditioning effects have been reported in the absence of the phenomenology of remembering the US valence [@waroquier_distinguishing_2020]. 
Hence, turning to phenomenological measures rather than to memory performance measures points to different conclusions.
While per-item procedures meet the information criterion, they however fail to meet the immediacy criterion: the requirement that awareness should be assessed at the time when the relevant cognitive process occurs (i.e., the one participants' awareness is about), not later [@mitchell_propositional_2009].
In per-item procedures, evaluations of all stimuli are typically elicited in a rating task, whereas memory is assessed in a different, independent task.

In contrast to per-item procedures, Process Dissociation procedures aimed at separating, this time at the aggregate level and within a single task, participants’ conscious memory for US valence from their attitude towards the CS in the absence of such explicit memory [@hutter_dissociating_2012]. 
In Process Dissociation procedures, participants indicate for each CS whether the CS was paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs (by selecting either a “pleasant” or “unpleasant” response). 
Alternatively, if participants cannot remember the valence of the US, they have to indicate whether they find the CS pleasant or unpleasant (using the same set of “pleasant” or “unpleasant” responses). 
Participants thus perform a two-stage decision within a single task. 
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not. The outcome of this decision determines how to proceed in the second stage—report the memory judgment from the first stage (if they remember US valence) or perform and report an attitude judgment (if they don’t remember US valence). 
Using multinomial processing modelling, these procedures found a small but significantly above-zero estimate for a parameter that was interpreted as indicative of US-consistent evaluations without conscious CS-US pairing memory. 
As classically achieved in Process Dissociation procedures [@jacoby_process_1991; for review see @yonelinas_processdissociation_2012], this was done by comparing response frequencies in conditions where attitudes towards the CSs and memory for their paired US valence operated synergistically (inclusion condition) versus antagonistically (exclusion condition).
	
Both per-item and process dissociation procedures have delivered valuable insights in evaluative learning research. 
These procedures, however, come with some limitations.
One important limitation applying to per-item procedures is that they involve a sequential measurement of CS evaluations and US memory. 
These multiple assessments imply additional measurement error. 
This is less of a problem in the process dissociation procedure as it involves a unique measurement for each CS. 
However, contrary to per-item procedures, data collected in process dissociation procedures are interpretable only at the group aggregate level (i.e., parameter estimates computed across inclusion and exclusion groups, based on data aggregated across items and persons). 
In doing so, these procedures do not conform to the information criterion. 
In addition, process dissociation procedures do not deliver information about memory judgments or evaluations of specific CSs. 
This restriction prevents addressing additional research questions requiring to relate memory states to evaluations at the item level (see also the general discussion). 
	
Here, we introduce a new procedure that makes the best of the two previous approaches while overcoming some of their limitations. 
Before doing so, however, it is important to discuss how these and complementary approaches have dealt with a decision heuristic that may contaminate memory assessments: the affect-as-information heuristic.
	
## The affect-as-information bias and how it was dealt with

Our current retrieval awareness question is concerned with whether CS evaluations elicited by a CS-US pairing procedure depend on the conscious retrieval of US valence. 
However, this question can be reliably answered only if memory reports are uncontaminated by CS evaluations. 
This is where affect-as-information comes into play. 
When participants lack memory but are nevertheless asked to select a “pleasant” or “unpleasant” response, they may respond on the basis of their feelings toward the CS (e.g., “the CS feels pleasant, so it must have been paired with positive USs”). 
This response pattern may then be mistakenly interpreted as indicating that an EC effect was accompanied by CS-US contingency memory. 
As a result, researchers are at risk of rejecting from the “US-unaware” category those CSs for which no conscious US memory existed but for which “false memory” was rather inferred from CS evaluation. 
Hence, affect-as-information can make per-item analyses too conservative a test for the possibility of evaluative conditioning effects in the absence of conscious retrieval.
	
As a side comment, the affect-as-information heuristic may explain reversed evaluative conditioning effects sometimes found for CSs with incorrect valence-memory responses (i.e., evaluative shifts and memory judgments inconsistent with actual US valence). 
The effect is assumed to be based on pre-experimental CS attitudes that are opposite to the valence of the US. 
If memory is absent for those CSs, then participants may use their pre-existing attitude to inform both their US memory judgment—leading to an incorrect valence-memory response—and their CS evaluations—leading to an evaluative effect opposite to the US’s valence (i.e., reversed EC). 
Such reversed evaluative conditioning effects for CS with incorrect memory responses were found in Stahl et al. (2009, Experiment 3; meta-analysis of Experiments 2–4).
	
Because of this contamination issue, studies have attempted to minimize, control, or assess the role of affect-as-information in the measurement of CS memory. 
In studies relying on per-item procedures, the contribution of affect-as-information was dealt with by introducing an “I don’t remember” response option in the memory task. 
In doing so, researchers avoided pressuring participants into reporting a CS-US pairing memory they did not feel confident about. 
In Process Dissociation studies, the issue does not apply anymore because participants are not forced to guess the US valence: if participants do not remember the US valence, they should indicate their attitude, not memory response. 
Finally, studies by Bar-Anan and colleagues [@bar-anan_effect_2014; @bar-anan_evaluative_2010] also provide relevant information to this debate. These authors manipulated attitudes experimentally before assessing how they affected US valence memories. 
Participants’ memory reports were biased toward their evaluation of the CS, which is consistent with the use of an affect-as-information heuristic. 
However, these authors found this bias to be absent from guessing and vague-memory cases; contrary to their expectations, it was restricted to cases where participants claimed to have clear memory of a pairing. 
These authors concluded that “evaluation influenced memory judgement in a way that participants experienced as clear memory, although it was only a reconstructed memory judgment based on evaluative information rather than true memory traces of past events.” (p.1042).
These findings importantly suggest that participants may rely on affect-as-information decision making, but not necessarily to overcome vague memories.

In sum, attitudes may bias memory measures even—or especially—when participants are confident of their memories and experience them as clear recollections. 
Yet, the findings reported by Bar-Anan and colleagues (2010, 2014) were based on old/new recognition judgments of specific CS-US pairs instead of valence-memory judgments, and so it is unclear how they affect valence-memory measures. 
As we validate the new procedure we propose here, we will be able to provide answers to this complementary question.
	
## Introducing the two buttons sets procedure (TBS)


(ref:task-displays) Task displays of the per-item valence-memory task (left), the process-dissociation task (center), and the TBS task (right).

```{r task-displays, fig.cap="(ref:task-displays)", fig.env = "figure*", fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/modPD_task_displays.png")
```

We introduce here a new procedure: the two buttons sets procedure (or TBS). 
The structure of the TBS is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:task-displays) (right). 
For the sake of clarity, the Figure also display the per-item and process dissociation procedures (left and center). 
Contrary to the original process dissociation procedure, the TBS introduces two sets of “pleasant”/“unpleasant” response buttons.
The first set is designated for memory judgments. 
The second set is designated for attitude judgments. 
Whenever participants decide that they remember US valence, they are instructed to use the Memory responses set (in the upper half of the screen) to report the outcome of their memory judgment. 
Alternatively, if they decide that they do not remember, participants are instructed to use the Attitude responses set (in the lower half of the screen) to report the outcome of their attitude judgment. 


The distinctive feature of the TBS is that it renders metacognitive decisions (i.e., whether participants feel they remember the US valence or whether they evaluate the CS in the absence of such retrieval experience) observable at the item-within-person level (see Figures \@ref(fig:pd-procedure-diagram)). 
This has three important advantages. 
First, because the memory decision is unveiled, it is no longer necessary to infer it indirectly from parameter estimates of a multinomial processing tree model, as is the case in the process dissociation approach. 
In turn, the between-subject instruction manipulation can be omitted so that a single group of participants is sufficient. 
This makes the modified procedure more efficient and flexible. 
For example, it can be used in within-participant designs that allow for more stringent experimental control as well as higher statistical power. 
Second, contrary to the per-item procedure but similar to the original process dissociation procedure, the immediacy criterion is met and the error measurement issue originating from multiple assessments of evaluation and memory is reduced. 
This is because a single measurement (either for US memory or for CS evaluation) is involved for each individual CS.
^[Although both of the TBS's questions must be answered by a single response, they may or may not involve only a single unitary memory retrieval operation. In a modeling framework such as MINERVA, it is plausible that a single operation would be sufficient, with the strength of the memory echo informing the Memory-Attitude decision, and the echo's content informing the choice of the pleasant/unpleasant response (for an application to EC, see Aust & Stahl, 2018; Aust, Haaf, & Stahl, 2019). Yet, participants may also approach the task differently, using a two-step approach involving multiple retrieval operations. Future empirical and modeling research is needed to address this question.]
Third, the CS-level information enables finer-grained analyses and more rigorous tests; most importantly, EC effects can be scrutinized at the item-within-person instead of the group level; hence, the TBS respects the information criterion. 



(ref:pd-procedure-diagram) Schematic comparison of the two-stage tasks in the process-dissociation (**A**) and TBS tasks (**B**). In both the process-dissociation and TBS tasks, participants first introspect whether they remember US valence or not. If they do remember US valence, they report their US-valence memory judgment; if they do not remember US valence, they report an attitude judgment. While the decision to report either a memory or attitude judgment remains unobserved in the process-dissociation task (A), it is observed as the choice between Memory and Attitude button sets in the TBS task (B). Panels with dashed lines represent unobservable latent states; those with solid lines observed task components. Bold rectangles represent observable response options at each task stage. Black and white arrows represent paths for positively and negatively paired CSs, respectively; grey arrows represent common paths.

```{dot, engine="dot", pd-procedure-diagram, code = readLines("./fig/modpd.dot"), fig.align = 'center', out.width = "0.75\\textwidth", fig.cap = "(ref:pd-procedure-diagram)", fig.ext = "pdf", fig.env = "figure*"}
```

To sum up, the TBS combines the advantages and reduces the limitations of the previous per-item and process-dissociation procedures by introducing slight but highly significant departures from these two procedures. 
The TBS is highly similar to the per-item procedure: 
It can be seen as expanding the "I don’t remember" response to a binary CS evaluation. 
The TBS is even more similar to the original process dissociation procedure: 
Here, participants' two-stage task remains the same, except that the TBS is augmented by a second set of “pleasant”/“unpleasant” buttons dedicated to the “I don’t remember” cases. 
This adaptation of the original process dissociation procedure allows memory and evaluation analyses at the item-within-person levels: 
Beyond procedural simplification (i.e., removing the need for a between-subjects manipulation of instruction), the TBS also simplifies data-analytical assumptions (i.e., it is no longer necessary to assume identical processes in the inclusion and exclusion conditions, nor independency across participants). 
Instead of using a MPT model as that proposed by Hütter et al. (2012) to produce what are hoped to be process-pure estimates of the cognitive processes of interest (in particular, EC in the absence of memory) at the group level, the TBS obtains per-item responses that are not claimed to be process pure but can be easily analyzed together with the results of other measures to investigate and scrutinize their validity.
In doing so, the TBS simplifies the original process dissociation procedure and provides important insights into metacognitive processes involved in participants’ decisions at the item level (i.e., which CS evaluation was associated with which phenomenological state of remembering).

These assets are helpful for examining the retrieval awareness and affect-as-information questions. As we will discuss in the general discussion, they are also helpful for addressing complementary questions. 
TBS data can be fruitfully related to the outcomes of other measures obtained from the same participant, for instance, evaluative (e.g., ratings) or (metacognitive) memory measures (e.g., Remember-Know-Guess or confidence judgments). 
Relating response-level responses to other measures allows investigating a wider range of research questions regarding the memory-evaluation relations. 
Observable memory decisions at the item level also allows assessing the accuracy of participants’ memory judgments (e.g., the proportion of “I don’t remember” cases in which correct US memory is nevertheless present).

<!-- pd: information -, immediacy + -->
<!-- tbs: info +, immediacy + -->

We now turn to the empirical section, where we validate the TBS and use it to address our current retrieval awareness and affect-as-information questions.


<!-- Importantly, however, the results of the first-stage 'remember' decision remains unobservable in the VM/A task (see Figure \@ref(fig:pd-procedure-diagram)A).  -->

<!-- According to the approach by Hütter et al., the two-stage task is performed under one of two different instruction conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)B):  -->



<!-- (ref:modPD) The novel VM/A task introduces a second set of response buttons. Participants still engage in the two-stage task (i.e., they first determine whether they remember US valence or not; then they report a memory judgment if they remember, or an attitude judgment if they don't). -->
<!-- The critical difference is that participants report the memory judgment using the Memory buttons (top), and the attitude judgment using the Attitude buttons (bottom), thus rendering their introspective decision observable. -->
 
 
# Overview of present studies

To empirically support the new TBS procedure in a manner comparable to that of the established tasks, we ran two validation studies.
The studies varied whether a CS was paired with a US or not, hence manipulating US memory. 
They also varied whether a CS was neutral or valenced, thereby manipulating CS attitudes. 
<!-- We assessed whether the memory manipulations were adequately reflected in the proportion of 'remember' responses, and whether the attitude manipulations were adequately reflected in CS evaluations in the absence of memory. -->
<!-- In addition, we used the TBS procedure to explore regularities of the relation between mnemonic and evaluative judgments, namely the attitude-as-information bias. -->
In addition to this validation part, we used the TBS procedure to investigate the retrieval awareness question (i.e., can evaluative conditioning effects be observed in the absence of conscious US Valence memory?) and whether attitudes contaminate memory measures (i.e., affect-as-information bias).

An additional goal of the present line of research was to compare the TBS with the process-dissociation procedures with a focus on testing the process-dissociation approach's underlying assumptions.
To mirror the process-dissociation procedure, in addition to the standard TBS instruction condition we also ran a group that worked on a TBS variant of the Exclusion instruction, and we collected additional memory measures at the end of the study.
<!-- The exclusion condition is not required by the modified PD procedure but was originally included to allow for testing the invariance assumption of the PD approach. -->
The present article does however not address this issue, and the data from that condition were not included in the analyses reported below, hence we omitted the TBS Exclusion condition and the memory measures from the empirical section (the data from these conditions and measures will be reported elsewhere and made available in the OSF repository).

In sum, the present study aims at (1) gathering empirical support for the validity of the TBS procedure, and (2) further exploring the attitude-as-information bias.

<!-- Towards these goals, we conducted two experiments that manipulated both memory and attitudes to show that these manipulations are adequately reflected in the metacognitive memory and attitude measures provided by the TBS task, and to probe for attitude-consistent memory judgments. -->

<!-- As a third goal, we aimed at informing strategies for controlling persuasive influences. -->
<!-- In applied contexts, strategies for controlling persuasive influences must rely on memory or metamemory judgments (such as those assessed in the present tasks) because these are typically the only pieces of information available in everyday situations. -->
<!-- It is therefore important to study the validity of these judgments in persuasion contexts in order to evaluate their usefulness in different types of control strategies. -->
<!-- Experiment 2 additionally collected additional memory measures that allowed us to explore the usefulness of metamemory judgments for informing control strategies.  -->


# Experiment 1

Experiment 1 probes the validity of the TBS task by manipulating both CS-US pairing memory and CS attitudes (within subjects) to test whether the manipulations selectively affect the Memory-set and Attitude-set responses.
CS stimuli were selected individually on the basis of a given participant's pre-study ratings.
To manipulate pairing memory, only the neutrally pre-rated CSs (but not the valent foils) were paired with USs during learning.
This should affect the frequency of Memory-set responses for the neutral CSs (compared to the valent foils).
To manipulate CS attitudes, the most valent (positive and negative) foil stimuli were compared (that were not paired with USs during learning):
For these stimuli, Attitude-set responses should reflect pre-rated attitudes.
Figure \@ref(fig:procedure) gives an overview of the experimental procedure.

(ref:procedure-caption) General procedure of Expts. 1 and 2. CS items were pre-rated and then assigned to within-subject conditions. After the learning phase, the TBS task was administered, followed by post-learning ratings.
<!-- and memory measures (US valence and US identity). In Exp.1, US valence memory was assessed using the per-item task (Stahl et al., 2009); in Exp.2, US valence memory was assessed using confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess judgments. -->
<!-- Exp. 1 had a 2 x 2 (repeated measures) design: Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired). The 24 most neutrally pre-rated face stimuli (for a given participant) were selected as neutral CSs (12 were paired with positive USs, and 12 with negative USs); the 16 most extremely rated ones (8 positive, 8 negative) were used as valenced control CSs. US valence memory was assessed using the per-item task (Stahl et al., 2009). -->
<!-- Experiment 2 had a 2 (TBS task: present vs. absent) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). The 24 most neutral and the 18 most valent stimuli (9 positive, 9 negative) were selected (42 in total; CSs: 16 neutral, 6 positive, 6 negative; non-paired foils: 8 neutral, 3 positive, 3 negative). Of the CSs, half of each subset were paired with USs of each valence. A given CS was paired twice with each of 4 different USs of the same valence. US valence memory was assessed using confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess judgments. -->

## Method

For the present studies, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations (except the inclusion/exclusion factor, as explained above), and all measures in the study (except the memory measures that were collected after the TBS and post-rating blocks, as explained above).
The study was registered prior to data collection and analysis (see osf.io/rkb3w; deviating from the preregistration, the present article does not report the analyses involving the inclusion/exclusion factor).
Materials, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/ygcz4.


### Participants and Design

The study realizes a 2 x 2 design with repeated measures: Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired).
We collected a sample of $N$=60 participants (students at the Université catholique du Louvain), as this is approximately 2x the sample size recruited by @hutter_dissociating_2012 (as recommended by the rule of thumb for replications by @simonsohn_small_2015).
We had to exclude the data from 1 participant who was accidentally run in both the inclusion and exclusion condition, and from 17 participants due to errors on instruction checks; the remaining sample consisted of $N$=42 participants.

### Materials and Procedure

We used the same materials as @hutter_dissociating_2012: A set of photographic images of faces served as CSs; a set of IAPS images served as USs.
The face CSs were pre-rated by participants by positioning a cursor on a slider ranging from 'very unpleasant' (-100) to 'very pleasant' (+100).
Of these faces, the 24 most neutrally pre-rated ones served as critical CSs (i.e., 12 paired with positive USs, 12 with negative USs).
The 16 most extremely pre-rated faces (8 of each valence) were not presented during the learning phase but served as valent control stimuli.
During learning, the 24 critical CSs were repeatedly paired with USs (i.e., each CS was presented once with one of 8 USs of the same valence).
Dependent measures were collected for all 40 CS stimuli (i.e., the two sets of 24 critical/paired and 16 control/nonpaired face photographs).

The procedure closely followed that of the @hutter_dissociating_2012 studies.
First, participants pre-rated all 120 face stimuli.
In the subsequent learning phase, CS and US images were presented side by side on the computer screen (positions were randomly selected for each trial).
After learning, memory and attitude were assessed for all 40 CSs.
The TBS task was implemented first.
After instructions were given, instruction understanding was tested: 
Participants were presented with descriptions of the possible combinations of memory and attitude states (one for each possible case), and were asked to select the corresponding response according to instructions.
TBS was followed by post-learning evaluative ratings.
<!-- Finally, memory for US valence and US identity were assessed:  -->
<!-- Participants were asked to indicate (successively for each CS) whether it had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs; they could also report that they "don't know" the correct response. -->
<!-- When assessing participants' US identity memory, we presented them with a set of 16 US images for a given CS, and asked them to select any one of the eight that had been paired with that CS during learning. -->

### Data analysis

As a manipulation check, the pre-post change in CS evaluations was computed (i.e., post-learning evaluation minus pre-learning evaluation) and submitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA to probe for US valence effects.
The TBS responses (i.e., choice of Memory vs. Attitude response-button sets; pleasant vs. unpleasant response) were analyzed using logistic regression analyses, with by-person random intercepts and slopes for the experimental factors.
In Experiment 1, random effects for interactions were also added; this was not possible in Experiment 2 because of the more complex design, which yielded a more complex model that was not supported given the relatively limited data. 
Omitting the interaction terms from the random-effects structure of the model did not reduce the model's goodness of fit, $\chi^2(30)=9.69, p=.99$. 
<!-- To gauge data quality, participants' understanding of instructions was assessed before they engaged in the task. -->
<!-- Overall, mean accuracy was approximately 75%. -->
<!-- <!-- (i.e., participants responded correctly in 6 out of 8 cases). -->

## Discussion

Results of Experiment 1 largely confirmed expectations:
First, the pairing manipulation was effective: a standard EC effect was found (along with a regression-to-the-mean effect for pre-experimentally valent stimuli), and the TBS procedure was successfully validated as a measure of memory as well as attitudes:
The choice of Memory-set versus Attitude response-button set reflected participants' metacognitive *remember* judgments (i.e., robustly higher rates of memory Memory-set responses for paired than non-paired stimuli); and Attitude-set responses reflected pre-learning evaluative ratings.

Second, we replicated previous memory-evaluation relations:
In line with Stahl et al. (2009), we found no EC in the absence of memory.
In line with Bar-Anan et al. (2010, 2014), we also found memory judgments for nonpaired stimuli to be biased by attitudes: 
Participants' valence-memory responses tended to be consistent with their pre-experimental ratings towards these stimuli.
This bias was obtained despite metacognitive 'remember' judgments, suggesting that participants were at least somewhat confident about their memories.

Note that Experiment 1 had several limitations.
Perhaps most importantly, as in previous studies, pairing memory and (pre-existing) attitude were confounded: 
Only neutrally pre-rated CSs were paired with (positive or negative) USs; valent CSs were never paired.
This meant that we could not assess the simultaneous effects of pairing and pre-experimental attitudes on the same set of CSs.
^[Each specific CS-US pairing was presented only once, while each stimulus (CS or US) was also paired with other stimuli (i.e., each CS was paired with 8 different USs; each US was paired, on average, with 2 different CSs).]
Experiment 2 addressed these limitations.

# Experiment 2

Experiment 2 examined the robustness of the findings from Experiment 1 and extended it in several ways: 
First, memory and attitudes were manipulated in a fully orthogonal within-subjects design by independently varying CS valence (positive, neutral, negative) and US valence (positive, non-paired, negative).
Second, new US material was used, and CS Material (human faces vs. toy figures) was additionally varied between subjects (this was done for generalization purposes; we did not expect any effects).
To control for carry-over effects on these measures from the TBS task, another group of participants was added that worked only on the latter two memory measures.
^[As in Experiment 1, we collected data for an additional TBS Exclusion condition and administered additional memory measures at the end of the study; this information is omitted from the Results section; and the data will be reported elsewhere and made available in the OSF repository.]

<!-- (ref:modPD2-caption) Experiment 2 had a 2 (TBS task: present vs. absent) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). Pre-ratings of CS pleasantness were followed by the learning phase, in which participants viewed CS-US pairs. After learning, the TBS task was implemented for the TBS-present group; the TBS-absent group skipped this task. Post-study evaluative ratings were finally collected. -->

## Method

The study was preregistered at osf.io/mxtwd (here we focus on validating the TBS procedure; the analyses addressing the other goals will be reported elsewhere).
Material, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/ygcz4.

### Participants and Design

Participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (*TBS*: present vs. absent) x 2 (*Material*: human faces vs. toy figures) between-subject design.
The sample consisted of $N$=76 students from the University of Cologne ($n_{TBS-present}=36, n_{TBS-absent}=40$).
^[The study aimed for $N=120$ participants (i.e., 20 in each of the six groups); after the final day of data collection a total of $N=123$ had participated.
As in @hutter_dissociating_2012, but deviating from Exp. 1, participants ($n=13$) were excluded who failed to correctly implement the instructions even after reading them for the third time.
The total sample consisted of $N=110$ participants (i.e., an additional n=34 completed a TBS-Exclusion condition not reported here).]
Within subjects, *US Valence* (positive, neutral/non-paired, negative) and *CS Valence* (positive, neutral, negative), were manipulated orthogonally.
 
### Material

As in Experiment 1, images of faces were used as CSs (deviating from Exp.1, we selected only the first 100 from the set of 120 images).
As additional CSs, we used 100 photographs of toy figures (*Gogo Crazy Bones*).
As USs, we used 112 color images from the OASIS database (@kurdi_introducing_2017; 56 positive and 56 negative, with comparable arousal ratings).
For a given participant, the most neutrally pre-rated 24 faces or toys as well as the 18 most valent faces or toys (9 positive, 9 negative) served as CSs.
Of the 24 neutral CSs, 16 were paired with USs (8 positive, 8 negative).
Of the initially valent CSs, 3 from each valence were paired with USs of each valence (i.e., 3 initially positive as well as 3 initially negative CSs were paired with positive USs; the other 3 from each valence set were paired with negative USs).
The remaining 8 neutral CSs, together with 3 positive and 3 negative CSs, comprised the set of 14 non-paired control stimuli.
A set of four different USs was randomly assigned to and uniquely paired with each CS; each US was paired twice with that CS.
Where possible, dependent measures were collected for all 42 CSs; US identity memory was not assessed for non-paired stimuli.

### Procedure

The procedure closely followed that of Experiment 1. 
Deviating from Experiment 1, evaluative ratings were collected on a 20-point (instead of 200-point) scale.
Further deviating from Experiment 1, but in line with Hütter et al. (2012), we presented participants with up to 3 rounds of instructions and instruction-check items; participants with errors on the last instruction-check round were excluded from analyses. 
^[Note that Exp. 2 was run in a different lab and implemented in a different programming environment.]

## Discussion

Confirming the manipulation's effectiveness, Experiment 2 again obtained a robust EC effect (along with regression to the mean for pre-experimentally valent CSs).
In line with Experiment 1, results again confirmed that the TBS task adequately reflects memory and attitude manipulations (i.e., Memory-set responses separated paired from non-paired stimuli; Attitude-set responses reflected pre-learning evaluative ratings).

Experiment 2 replicated the attitude-as-information bias in memory judgments for nonpaired stimuli: 
Participants were more likely to remember (un)pleasant USs being paired with pre-experimentally positive (negative) nonpaired stimuli. 
Going beyond Experiment 1, here we orthogonally manipulated US Valence and CS Valence and found an effect of attitudes-as-information (i.e., CS Valence) not only for nonpaired foils but also for paired CSs.

Experiment 2 also found no EC effect in the absence of memory on the TBS task: 
Attitude-set judgments were not affected by US Valence.
In addition, for those CSs for which participants indicated that they do not remember US valence by using the Attitude-set responses, pre-post evaluative change as measured by evaluative ratings also failed to reflect US Valence.

Put differently, participants were able, to different degrees, to selectively use the two sources (CS and US) of valence in their judgments:
On the one hand, US valence had a selective influence only on Memory-set but not Attitude-set judgments.
On the other hand, the effects of CS valence (although less selective) were stronger on Attitude-set judgments (where they reflected valid responding in adherence with task instructions) than on Memory-set judgments (where they reflected an attitude-as-information bias). 

By presenting participants with valent as well as neutral items, and with paired as well as non-paired items, Experiment 2 was able to separate effects of pairing from those of (pre-existing) evaluations. 
This relatively complex design is however uncommon in EC studies, which have typically presented only neutral CSs paired with either pleasant or unpleasant USs.
One may argue, therefore, that the findings obtained in Experiment 2 may be a function of this complexity, and that different findings may obtain in the more simple design commonly used in EC studies.
To test whether the TBS finding of no EC-without-memory effect was somehow biased by the presence versus absence of valent and/or nonpaired items, we conducted another study with the simple design.


# Experiment 3

This study aims at replicating and strengthening the evidence --- that no EC is found when participants experience a lack of memory --- with higher statistical power, and in a simplified design (i.e., without nonpaired and valent stimuli) that is more comparable to previous studies.

In a second condition, we replicated the study by Waroquier et al. (2020), who reported EC effects when participants indicated that they did not have conscious knowledge about the US's valence. 
In their study, after the learning phase, participants were presented with a CS and asked to report the valence of the associated US.
They were then asked to attribute their response to a mental state (i.e., to indicate the basis of their valence-memory response): memory (i.e., remembered the pairing), feeling (familiarity or intuition), or random guessing.
In their Experiment 1, they found EC effects not only for memory but also for feeling attributions; in their Experiment 2, EC was found for memory and random-guessing, but not for feeling attributions.
These results contrast with the TBS finding of no EC in the absence of memory, suggesting that a more fine-grained distinction of different mental states (i.e., three rather than two), and/or a more sensitive measurement (i.e., rating scale rather than binary choice) may be more suited for detecting EC without memory.

To begin exploring possible reasons for the discrepancy, we included a third condition in which we adapted the TBS approach of conditionally assessing either memory or attitudes as a function of retrieval awareness.
Specifically, we distinguished between three (rather than two) states; and we replaced the binary attitude judgments by continuous rating scales.
Participants' task was to assess their memory for US valence; if they remembered it, they were to report in using binary pleasant/unpleasant buttons as in the TBS; if they had some gut feeling or intuition, they were asked to evaluate the CS on a rating scale; similarly, if they felt they were guessing randomly, they were asked to evaluate the CS on another rating scale.
With these modifications, the task yielded data highly similar to those obtained by Waroquier et al. (2020), but with a higher degree of adherence to the immediacy criterion (i.e., the data were obtained from a single response at a single point in time, rather than separated across trials or even separate blocks).

In sum, we implemented a between-subjects manipulation of valence-memory task type with three levels: 
Participants completed either the TBS, VMA, or 3BS task.
We also counterbalanced the order of post-experimental evaluative ratings and the valence-memory task (which had no effect on the results).
^[To begin exploring the relation between memory judgments on the different memory tasks, we also varied task type within-subjects:
Participants completed a second valence-memory task (i.e., participants in the TBS and 3BS condition completed the VMA task, and participants in the VMA condition completed a TBS task).
Finally, to explore the accuracy of subjective memory attributions, participants completed a US identity memory task.
The results of these tasks are not reported in the present paper (which focuses on the validation of the TBS task); procedural details of these tasks will be reported in an online appendix (osf.io/xxxxx).]

## Method

### Participants and Design

Participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (valence-memory task: TBS, VMA, 3BS) x 2 (order: evaluative ratings first vs. valence-memory task first) between-subjects design.
They were recruited from the lab database (i.e., University of Cologne student population) and were invited to participate either in the lab or via internet.
As compensation, course credit or an amount of EUR 8 was offered.
We recruited participants until there were at least 180 participants who had passed the instruction-understanding checks. Of the 201 participants, 15 were excluded because they failed the seriousness or attention checks (i.e., they either indicated that their data should not be used for scientific purposes, or that they were not able to pay sustained attention during the learning phase). We additionnally excluded one participant for which stimulus presentation in the learning phase did not work as intended. This resulted in a final sample size of 185 participants.

### Material

We used the same face images as Waroquier et al., but replaced the IAPS images (which cannot be used in online studies for licence reasons) by comparable images from the OASIS database.
Participants pre-rated 60 images, and the 40 most neutral ones were used as CSs in all subsequent study phases.
Half of them were assigned to be paired with positive CSs, the other half with negative CSs; each CS was paired with a single US.
An additional set of 3 US images of the same valence were assigned to each CS to be used as foils in the test of US identity memory.

### Procedure

The procedure was similar to the previous studies (with procedural details closely following those from Waroquier et al., 2020).
After collecting pre-study ratings, the learning phase began, presenting 240 trials in which a CS and a US were shown simultaneously and side by side on the screen for 1500 ms (with a 100 ms ISI).
Participants were instructed to carefully watch all the stimuli.
As an attention check, they were also asked to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever a fixation cross was presented in the center of the screen.
After the study phase, half of participants first gave post-study ratings of all 40 CSs and then engaged in the valence-memory task (i.e., TBS, VMA, or 3BS); the other half completed the tasks in the reverse order (i.e., valence-memory task first, ratings second).
After the valence-memory task instructions were given, participants' understanding was probed by presenting them with several instruction-check items.
Each item described a scenario (e.g., "you remember that the given CS was presented with a pleasant US") and asked participants to respond according to the instruction they had just read.
In case of erroneous responses to one or more instruction-check items, instructions were presented and probed again (up to a total of 3 times); participants with errors in the last round were excluded from analyses.
The respective valence-memory task commenced after instruction checks were completed; afterwards, half of participants completed the post-learning evaluative ratings for the 40 CSs.
For exploratory reasons, we subsequently presented participants with another valence-memory task (VMA or TBS), followed by an US-identity memory task (see above).
Finally, participants were asked whether they paid attention during the learning phase, whether they thought their data should be analyzed for scientific purposes (or were subpar for any reason), and about the setting in which they completed the study (in the lab, alone in a quiet setting, a quiet setting with other people, with other people and occasional interruptions, a lively environment with frequent interruptions).

## Discussion

Results were consistent across tasks: 
Robust EC effects were found for memory attributions; the evidence for EC was inconclusive for "intuition" attributions; and EC was clearly absent for random-guessing/no-memory attributions.
This pattern of results is in line with those of Experiments 1 and 2, which also found EC only for "remember" but not for "don't remember" attributions.
They support the validity of the results obtained with the TBS task.
In particular, the same results were obtained regardless of whether nonpaired and valent stimuli were included in the design or not.
The findings from Experiments 1 and 2 are therefore not artifacts of their inclusion.
The TBS, with these items included, is a much more powerful tool for investigating the attitude-as-information and other heuristics.  

The present evidence for the absence of EC in the absence of memory contrasts with the finding of EC for "random guessing" cases in waroquier et al.'s () Experiment 2 (both on the immediate and delayed test) as well as in a meta-analysis of their Experiments 1 and 2.
Given that our study is a close replication of the studies by Waroquier, we could only speculate about the reasons for the discrepancy (i.e., there were differences in participant populations, US stimuli, language of instructions); more research is needed to replicate their EC effect for random-guessing attributions and to explain why we failed to do so.

With regard to the "intuition" attributions, our findings are in line with those by Waroquier et al., who also found inconclusive evidence for these cases (i.e., there was evidence for feeling-based EC in Exp.1, but it was inconclusive in the immediate test of Exp.2, and there was evidence for the absence of EC on the delayed test).
To identify the factors underlying "intuitive" EC, future research should aim at better understanding the subjective state of "intuition" attributions, and its relation to similar subjective memory reports such as "know" judgments that are often associated with familiarity-based or semantic memory retrieval.


# General Discussion

In this general discussion, we first summarize the main insights of the new procedure introduced here.
Next, we discuss its limitations, and we explain how it can be further improved and used to advance attitude research.

## Main findings

The present research introduced a new measurement procedure - the TBS task - for advancing the study of (potential) EC effects without retrieval awareness. 
In the introduction, we discussed the assets of the TBS relative to prior procedures. 
We validated this new task in two experiments, which additional provided insights into the influence of attitude-as-information processes typically found in retrieval-awareness studies. 
In this section, we discuss the main findings observed here in light of these main objectives.

### Validity of TBS task

Our first aim was to test the validity of the TBS task.
In two experiments, we influenced memory by pairing some stimuli with USs, while other stimuli were never paired with USs; and we influenced attitudes by using stimuli pre-rated as pleasant or unpleasant.
The manipulations of pairing memory were reflected in participants' metacognitive judgments (i.e., their use of the Memory-set vs. Attitude-set), as well as their valence-memory reports when they used the Memory set.
The manipulations of attitudes were reflected in participants' pleasantness judgments when they used the Attitude set.
These results confirm a successful validation of the TBS task, comparable to the process-dissociation procedure [@hutter_dissociating_2012].

It is particularly important to highlight the validity of TBS results regarding EC in the absence of memory. 
In the presence of attitude-as-information on TBS responses, it may be asked whether the findings of the absence of EC without memory can be interpreted.
To clarify, the inclusion of both valent and non-paired items allowed us to separate effects of CS valence from those of US valence induced via CS-US pairings. 
For instance, for paired as well as non-paired items, effects of pre-experimental CS Valence on Memory-set responses can be interpreted as attitude-as-information biases. 
As another point of validation, note that we also found that attitude-as-information (i.e., pre-experimental CS valence) did not affect participants’ choice of the Memory vs. Attitude response sets. 
This means that CS attitudes (pre-existing or learned) did not distort subjective decisions about having memory or not. 
For paired items, then, effects of US Valence on Memory-set responses can be interpreted as reflecting US valence memory; and effects of US Valence on Attitude responses (if there were any) could be interpreted as reflecting EC effects in the absence of memory.

### Evaluative conditioning and retrieval awareness

Our second aim was to assess whether evaluative conditioning requires conscious retrieval of US valence.
Using the TBS task, we obtained CS-level data on evaluations in the metacognitive absence of US memory. 
While CS evaluations in the absence of retrieval awareness reflected preexisting attitudes (attesting to their validity), they were however consistently unaffected by US valence.
In sum, both studies found no EC when participants' metacognitive judgments indicated memory for US valence to be absent.

At first sight, this result is inconsistent with process-dissociation results, which have reported evidence for EC in the absence of US valence memory [@hutter_dissociating_2012].
However, this apparent inconsistency can be resolved when a recent meta-analysis of such studies is considered.
Across 12 PD studies [@mierop_does_2018], this analysis yielded an overall mean estimate of *A*=.07, 95% CI [.04, .11].
First, this is a relatively small effect; it corresponds to approximately 1 out of the 24 CSs typically presented to a given participant being governed by the "EC in the absence of memory" branch of the MPT model.
^[With estimates of *M* around .5, valence memory was present for about half of the CSs (i.e., 12 out of 24); of the remaining half, an average of 7% of responses was found to be consistent with the "EC-without-memory" pattern (i.e., 7% of 12 CSs amounts to less than 1 CS).]
<!--Put differently, EC was found for approximately 7% *of those CSs for which no memory was present, are estimated to show EC effects in the absence of memory for US valence.-->
Second, the meta-analysis also revealed substantial heterogeneity (*I*² = 56%), reflecting the fact that the confidence interval of *A* excluded zero in 5 out of 12 studies, whereas it included zero in the remaining 7 studies.
In sum, while PD studies yield some meta-analytic evidence for the persistence of EC effects in the absence of US-valence memory, the effect is small and contingent on unknown enabling conditions.
Given sample sizes comparable to (and considerably larger than some) previous studies, the present null results are unlikely to reflect lack of power. 
It remains possible, of course, that EC in the absence of retrieval awareness will be found in other studies that realize (as yet elusive) critical enabling conditions.

The finding of no EC in the absence of retrieval awareness is more in line with previous conclusions obtained with per-item procedures that also found no EC when participants indicated not remembering the valence of the paired US [@stahl_respective_2009].
It is however at odds with a recent per-item result by @waroquier_distinguishing_2020 showing EC even when participants reported having no memory of US valence (i.e., when they indicated having randomly guessed whether the US's valence was positive or negative).
There are two important differences between the present studies and theirs that may account for the inconsistent result patterns.
First, while the present TBS task allowed for only two different metacognitive states (i.e., participants could report either remembering or not-remembering), the task used by Waroquier et al. required a finer distinction of three or four metacognitive states (i.e., memory, intuition, familiarity, random guessing).
On the one hand, such a fine-grained distinction may put too high a demand on participants [especially if instructions fail to clearly explain the different states; for a discussion in the context of the related Remember/Know procedure see @migo_measuring_2012]. 
On the other hand, a finer-grained distinction may be required to validly tap the different possible metacognitive states [e.g., structural vs. judgment knowledge, @dienes_unconscious_1995; @dienes_measuring_2005].
As a second difference, while in the TBS task participants reported their metacognitive state simultaneously with the pleasant/unpleasant judgment, valence-memory and metacognitive attribution were assessed sequentially (Exp. 1) or even in separate blocks (Exp. 2) in the studies by Waroquier et al. (2020).
With a delay between judgments, their retrieval awareness measure met the immediacy criterion less well than in the present TBS.
One may, therefore, speculate that their results reflect the addition of noise to the evaluation-awareness relation, which could lead to an artificial "EC without awareness" pattern.

The present Experiment 3 yields first tentative evidence.
First, we could not replicate the findings by Waroquier et al. (2020) of an EC effect with "random guessing" attributions; instead, EC was clearly absent for these cases. 
Second, the finding of an EC effect for "intuition" attributions replicates Waroquier et al.'s (2020) finding of EC in the absence of what they term "conscious structural knowledge" (see also Dienes & Scott, 2005):
The relevant knowledge structure in EC is the association between the CS and the US's valence (with this knowledge, participants could consciously produce EC).
Participants reported that they did not remember the valence of the US (i.e., they had no conscious structural knowledge); yet, they still showed EC.
In this sense, one may argue that they showed unconscious EC.
Note, however, that participants indicated that they had some form of intuition about the US'S valence---an experience similar to "Know" responses in the RKG task that is similarly based on memory retrieval but of a more gradual kind (i.e., one that does not elicit a clear experience of recollection).
It remains open whether these findings reflect some participants' conservative decision criteria (i.e., a tendency to respond "intuition" for somewhat weaker memory experiences) or a distinct process altogether.
Clearly, however, this finding (if robust) will be important both for research into the processes underlying evaluative memories as well as for applied research targeting strategies for controlling persuasive influences.

In sum, we saw that a more fine-grained task that distinguishes not only memory and no-memory states but also allows for intuition attributions can yield interesting novel findings - especially so when it used a continuous rating scale rather than a binary response.

Future research is needed to provide more conclusive responses to these questions.

Whether, when, and through which processes EC effects can be found in the absence of retrieval awareness bears important theoretical implications. 
The evaluative conditioning literature distinguishes between Stimulus-Stimulus and Stimulus-Response evaluative learning models. Stimulus-Stimulus models assume that CS-US links are encoded in memory and that their retrieval influences participants' judgments at the decision stage. 
For these models, EC effects are contingent upon a successful retrieval of the CS-US pairings from memory. 
Alternatively, Stimulus-Response models assume that the affective responses elicited by the US (rather than the US as such) is linked to the CS in long-term memory [for a recent discussion, see @corneille_associative_2019; see also @jones_implicit_2009; @sweldens_evaluative_2010]. 
For these models, the retrieval of a CS directly elicits the learned affective response. 
Hence, neither the encoding nor the retrieval of a CS-US pairing is required to observe EC effects.

Stimulus-Response learning is thought to operate via a "direct transfer" of the US valence to the CS [e.g., @hutter_dissociating_2018; @sweldens_evaluative_2010] or via implicit misattribution. The latter is thought to occur when, at the learning stage, participants mistakenly attribute their affective response to the CS instead of attributing it to the US [e.g., @jones_implicit_2009]. 
In turn, implicit misattribution processes are expected to operate under specific conditions that are conducive to confusability about the source of one's affective reaction [e.g., @jones_implicit_2009; @hutter_implicit_2013]. 
These conditions were not met in the learning paradigms used for the present research. Recent evaluative conditioning research, however, casts doubts on the existence of stimulus-response learning in more conducive conditions. 
In particular, evidence for unaware EC effects in the original paradigm [@olson_implicit_2001], failed to be supported in more recent studies that relied on this paradigm [@moran_incidental_2020, Kurdi et al., 2022 ]. 
Another piece of evidence for stimulus-response learning, relating to source confusability, was also compromised in recent studies. 
Specifically, implicit misattribution assumes stronger EC effects when US valence is mild rather than high. This is because a very valent US is unlikely to elicit confusion about the source of one's affective reaction. 
Recent research failed to find evidence consistent with this rationale [@mierop_does_2018].
Finally, that a memory-independent parameter has been found in instruction-based procedures [@hutter_examining_2017-1] further challenges an associative interpretation of the findings [for a related point, see also @corneille_evidence_2019].

### Affect-as-information bias

Correlations between US valence memory and evaluations do not necessarily reflect a dependence of EC effects on retrieval awareness. 
For instance, when participants lack US valence memory, they may use their attitudes to inform their memory judgments; in that case, a potential "EC without memory" effect is masked.
To circumvent this problem, per-item tasks have asked participants to indicate when they do not remember US valence (e.g., by responding "I don't remember"), and the process-dissociation and TBS tasks have asked them to report their attitudes (instead of US valence memory) whenever they feel they do not remember.
However, more recently it was found that attitude-as-information bias may also affect metacognitive "remember" states [@bar-anan_effect_2014; @bar-anan_evaluative_2010], and here we assessed whether this is the case also for valence-memory judgments in the TBS task.
In support of this possibility, Memory-set judgments of nonpaired foil stimuli were affected by participants' attitudes towards these stimuli.

Thus, attitude-as-information bias was obtained for cases for which participants had a certain amount of confidence in their memory, as they indicated remembering US valence (i.e., used Memory-set responses on the TBS task), and despite the option to refrain from reporting US valence memory (i.e., they could have reported an Attitude-set or "don't remember" response).
These observations are at odds with the suggestion that attitude-as-information bias stems from a heuristic used under uncertainty that is linked to forced responding; they are consistent with the findings reported by Bar-Anan et al. (2010, 2014) suggesting that cases of attitude-consistent responding may be experienced, subjectively, as true remembering.
<!-- Thus, rather than reflecting a heuristic such as “I don’t remember the US, but I like the CS so it must have been paired with a pleasant US”, this phenomenon may reflect a different kind of attitude-as-information bias. One possibility is a heuristic in which the feeling of having a clear evaluation of a stimulus (regardless of its valence) is misattributed as a feeling of remembering of (or strong familiarity with) the stimulus.  -->
<!-- Such a bias would be ecologically plausible in the sense that one's (positive or negative) evaluations are often accompanied with, or result from, (pleasant or unpleasant) experiences. -->
<!-- The misattribution of pre-existing attitudes to a particular recent experiences may pose a threat to the validity of metacognitive judgments in guiding strategies to control our behavior. -->
<!-- If we tend to falsely believe that our attitudes towards an object stem from a specific recent experiential source, then we may discount our (valid) attitudes and could allow less reliable sources of information guide our behaviors. -->
Additional research is needed to address this phenomenon, and its consequences for the controllability of evaluative-conditioning influences on attitudes and behavior.



<!-- ## Additional findings -->

<!-- - asymmetric valence effects: stronger EC for positive USs (perhaps due to opposing mere-exposure effects) -->

## Limitations and open questions

The TBS is limited in that it (1) addresses only deliberate evaluations, (2) distinguishes only two metacognitive states, and (3) addresses only a very specific issue.
Here we discuss these limitations and sketch possible ways to address them in future developments.

### Intentional control versus awareness of knowing

When focusing on the consciousness feature of (un)intentional control, it can be debated whether the TBS task is indeed an improvement upon the PD approach.
Tapping the ability to intentionally control information is critical in many PD applications, which typically aim at dissociating two distinct contributions to behavior, only one of which is under intentional control.
The inclusion-exclusion instruction manipulates how the controllable process is mapped onto the set of responses, and it is assumed that the uncontrollable process affects responses in the same way in both instruction conditions.
In other words, participants in the PD task can only reverse the response assignment in the exclusion condition for intentionally controllable information; the response pattern remains unaffected by the instruction manipulation insofar as there are also uncontrollable contributions.

On the other hand, by-item measures of valence memory required participant's judgment knowledge (i.e., whether a CS had been paired with positive or negative USs), as well as their awareness of knowing (i.e., they ask participants to respond 'dont know' if they are unaware of any knowledge).
The TBS similarly taps these two aspects of awareness, albeit in a slightly different way (i.e., it asks participants to report their attitude if they are not aware of having any knowledge).
For both the by-item and TBS tasks, we assume that the subjective knowledge state (i.e., being aware of either having knowledge or of not having knowledge) can be used intentionally (i.e., participants intentionally select whether to report their memory or their attitude).

Importantly, controlling the use of a piece of information or knowledge is not the same as being aware of knowing it (i.e., control may be possible for unconscious knowledge, that is, for which awareness of knowing is lacking; it is also conceivable, at least, that awareness of knowledge may be present in some situations while that knowledge uncontrollably affects a specific task). 
Hence, if the TBS and the PD approach (as applied to assessing EC without memory by Hütter et al.) were to capture distinct features of consciousness, this might explain different patterns of results (and would prohibit presenting the TBS task as an improvement of the PD approach).

While it may generally be possible to control the use of unconscious information strategically (i.e., in the absence of awareness of knowing), we would argue that this does not characterize the PD task as it is applied to EC by Hütter et al.
In our view, participants in the PD approach also requires awareness of knowing as well as judgment knowledge in order to follow instructions: 
To be able to select the relevant part of the instruction (i.e., report memories or attitudes), participants have to decide whether, subjectively, they have knowledge or not (i.e., they need awareness of their knowledge); to be able to report their attitude (or memory), they require judgment knowledge (i.e., whether a CS had been paired with positive or negative USs). 
Importantly, this knowledge must be under their intentional control, so that they can follow the respective inclusion or exclusion instruction (i.e., report veridical versus reversed attitudes or memories).
In this sense, the PD approach to assessing EC without memory is not a traditional PD paradigm that capitalizes on (un)controllability of (in this case) attitudinal information --- to the contrary, it assumes and requires attitudinal information to be controllable.
Instead, it hinges on the subjective assessment of having (versus not having) conscious knowledge about CS-US pairings; it is this subjective awareness of (not) knowing that determines whether a response is reversed or not.
^[This interpretation is in line with Waroquier et al. () who have also characterized the PD task as a subjective measure.]



### Deliberate memory retrieval and evaluations

The TBS relies on deliberate evaluations; results and conclusions may differ when implicit attitude measures are used; and future research is needed to relate the results of direct and indirect measurement approaches. 
It is unclear, however, on which basis "explicit" and "implicit" attitude measures should be distinguished from each other. 
At present, the distinction reflects social convention rather than be grounded in a compelling empirical or theoretical rationale  [for a thorough discussion, see @corneille_implicit_2020].
If "implicit" is understood as "automatic", then the TBS clearly allowed for the influence of unconscious (memory) processes. 
This is also true for deliberate evaluations used in Process Dissociation studies.
We note that the TBS could be adapted for addressing other features of automaticity, such as efficient responding, for example by requesting speeded evaluations.

Relatedly, the TBS explicitly asks participants whether they have memory for the CS-US pairings; this instruction should induce them to try to retrieve their memory for the pairings.
What we found is that EC is only observed with successful retrieval.
However, it is possible that participants would show EC effects without retrieving CS-US pairing memory, if they were not explicitly asked to do so.
In other words, whereas EC may require pairing memory, it may not in all circumstances require the conscious retrieval of those memories at the time of CS evaluations.
This theoretical possibility could be tested, for instance, with the help of indirect measures of memory retrieval in future studies.

Another question is whether different conclusions may be reached when using physiological measures. 
For instance, studies have claimed successful subliminal conditioning for salivating response but not for evaluations [@passarelli_augmenting_2022]. 
Although recent research suggests the involvement of convergent evaluative learning processes for behavioral (direct or indirect) and physiological measures [@corneille_behavioral_2020], one should be open to the possibility that different learning or decision making processes are operating when specific physiological responses, or specific populations, are under consideration. 
Likewise, one may speculate that behavioral measures capitalizing on preference rather than absolute evaluative judgments [@amd_dissociating_2020] may be more sensitive to memory-independent processes. 
Finally, one should be careful not generalizing the conclusions reached here in the context of evaluative conditioning to other forms of learning from pairings, such as reward learning [@leganes-fonteneau_avoiding_2021].

### Coarse metacognitive distinction

The TBS distinguishes between only two different metacognitive states - remembering versus non-remembering; it does not allow participants to distinguish between different states of (not) having memory.
In particular, several important dissociations have been made in previous research, for instance between remembering versus knowing [@wixted_continuous_2010], or structural versus judgment knowledge [@dienes_measuring_2005]. 
The TBS task is however easily extended to allow for more fine-grained metacognitive distinctions.
For instance, an extended TBS task could offer three button sets, one each for Remembering, Knowing, and Guessing, to address whether the EC-without-memory result obtained by @waroquier_distinguishing_2020 reflect an artifact due to lack of immediacy, or whether their more fine-grained metacognitive distinctions were better able to isolate the relevant cases than the present TBS task.

### Going beyond the EC-without-memory issue

The TBS was used here for addressing one very specific research question in attitude research, but it may be adapted for addressing other, similarly structured questions.
For instance, there is a related issue in research on truth judgments, which depend on participants' memory for the statement in question:
It is typically found that repeatedly presented statements are judged to be more valid  [@dechene_truth_2009]. 
The TBS task could be adapted to assess validity instead of pleasantness, and separate validity judgments in the metacognitive presence versus absence of memory. 
Previous research has suggested that it is not the factual repetition that increases validity judgments, but that instead a perceived repetition (i.e., a false alarm) is sufficient for an effect on validity [@bacon_credibility_1979; see also @mattavelli_truth_2021].
In addition to providing a simple assessment of metamemory status, a parallel application of the TBS task to truth judgments could also help investigate whether similar judgment biases affect both types of ratings (e.g., whether statements perceived as more valid are also more likely to be judged 'remembered').
Likewise, mere exposure effects may be revisited using the TBS. 
In mere exposure studies, stimuli are preferred when participants have processed them earlier relative to when they are novel [@zajonc_attitudinal_1968]. 
Many studies have supported the view that this preference may arise independently of a conscious recollection of the old status of the item [@zajonc_mere_2001], or even be compromised by conscious recollection [e.g., @bornstein_stimulus_1992; @newell_recognising_2007; @whittlesea_implicit_2001]. 
Here too, the use of the TBS may be useful for shedding complementary light on these questions.
Finally, recent findings in the literature on artifical grammar learning (AGL) have found evidence for EC in the absence of awareness of knowing (Jurchiș et al., 2020).
In that study, awareness of knowing and EC were assessed using distinct measures; hence, the result is potentially susceptible to a lack of immediacy.
It would be interesting to test whether the finding can be replicated in a variant of the TBS task applied to the AGL paradigm.

<!-- ### Simultaneous assessment -->

<!-- Reliability is higher when confidence ratings are provided simultaneously with type 1 choices [@guggenmos_measuring_2021]. -->
<!-- Simultaneous assessments of choice and confidence are readily implemented for binary decisions (e.g., positive/negative, old/new, present/absent) by placing the two response options at the opposing ends of a one-dimensional confidence rating scale, as for example when assessing recognition judgments (using, e.g., a 6-point, confidence-graded scale (1 0 definitely not studied, 2 0 probably not studied, 3 0 maybe not studied, 4 0 maybe studied, 5 0 probably studied, and 6 0 definitely studied).  -->
<!-- Alternatively, two distinct scales can be presented for the two options, as for example in a motion-detection study in which participants reported a left-(right-)ward motion by selection the left (right) scale, and indicated their confidence by the position on that scale (top: certain; bottom: guessing)[@zylberberg_influence_2016; @orchard_internal_2021]. -->
<!-- These designs are conceptually identical, in that both represent a single confidence dimension, ranging from high confidence for one of the two response options, via an indifference point, to high confidence for the other option. -->

<!-- ### Assessing two metacognitive dimensions simultaneously -->

<!-- It is also possible to jointly tap more than one dimension. -->
<!-- For instance, in addition to old/new recognition and confidence, Remember vs. Know experience has been accessed in some recognition memory studies [@ingram_recollection_2012]: -->
<!-- Participants were presented with an old-new confidence scale that forked into two subscales on the "old" side of the scale, one to be used for recollection and another for familiarity experiences. -->
<!-- This approach allowed controlling for confidence in comparing recollection-based with familiarity-based memories; it successfully discovered distinct associations with source memory accuracy, supporting the validity of metacognitive remember/know experiences.  -->
<!-- The present approach could similarly be extended toward assessing both confidence and retrieval experience simultaneously. -->
<!-- For instance, the binary "remember/don't remember" distinction could be replaced by a ternary "Remember/Know/don't remember or know" judgment; the binary "pleasant/unpleasant" choice replaced by continuous "pleasant-unpleasant" scales, tapping degree of confidence when assessing memory, and valence extremity when assessing attitudes. -->

<!-- ### Addressing the limitation of conditional assessment -->

<!-- The present task's conditional assessment of either US memory (when a person "remembers" US valence) or CS attitude (when they "don't remember") considerably restricts the available information. -->
<!-- If possible, both US memory and CS attitude should be available for each CS-US pair. -->
<!-- As one possible way towards this goal, the respective information missing in a given trial could be collected directly afterwards: -->
<!-- For remembered pairings, participants would indicate their attitude towards the CS; for non-remembered pairings, participants would guess the US's valence. -->
<!-- This would allow the present task to remain unchanged, but the varying prompts might lead to increased demands on participants. -->
<!-- Another option would be to simplify the task to only elicit memory judgments (for both "remember" and "don't remember" cases), and to rely on the separate evaluative ratings as an attitude index. -->
<!-- The downside of this approach would be the relative temporal separation of evaluative and metacognitive judgments, which would reduce the reliability of conclusions about evaluative effects in the absence of US valence memory. -->
<!-- As a third option, CS evaluation and US memory judgment might be consistently combined in a single trial; this would require another modification of the present task but would keep its benefit of close temporal proximity of evaluative and metacognitive judgments. -->
<!-- Future research should empirically explore these options. -->

<!-- We are planning to explore this possibility in future studies. -->

<!-- ### Measures of metacognition -->

<!-- In further developing the assessment procedures, researchers should aim at obtaining data suitable for computing established numerical measures of metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency [e.g., meta-d'; @maniscalco_lau_2012; @barrett_Etal_2013; @guggenmoos_2021]. -->
<!-- Such measures can then serve as a basis for a more rigorous analysis of the role of metacognition in the domain of attitude learning. -->

## Conclusions and outlook

Studying the relation between EC effects and memory for CS-US pairings is of theoretical interest for models of learning, and also of practical interest for research into the controllability of persuasive influences on consumer behavior.
Here we have proposed and validated a novel method for this kind of research, one that combines the advantages of the previous per-item and process-dissociation approaches; and we have shown how this new method can be further adapted and extended.
The present studies have also yielded novel findings (EC effects associated with intuitive or gut-feeling knowledge about US valence; attitude-as-information effects when participants report remembering US valence) that we hope will stimulate future research on this topic.
