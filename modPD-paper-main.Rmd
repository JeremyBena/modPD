abstract: |
  Research on Evaluative Conditioning (EC) that relied on a Process Dissociation (PD) procedure supports the possibility of attitude learning effects acquired or maintained in the absence of explicit memory. In the present research we argue that basic assumptions inherent to the PD procedure are both theoretically and empirically unjustified. We introduce and empirically validate an alternative fine-grained assessment of subjective memory states. The data of the validation study (i) question central assumptions of the PD procedure, (ii) fail to support the assumptions posited in dual-learning models of attitudes that attitudes can be acquired or maintained without memory, and (iii) highlight the importance of distinguishing between objective and subjective memory. We discuss the implications of the present findings for attitude research.

# Experiment 1

Experiment 1 probes the validity of the modified PD  by manipulating both CS-US pairing memory and CS attitudes (within subjects) to test whether the manipulations selectively affect the Memory and Attitude responses. 
CSs were selected individually on the basis of a given participant's pre-study ratings.
To manipulate pairing memory, neutrally pre-rated CSs were paired with USs during learning.
This should affect the frequency of subjective Memory responses (as well as the accuracy of the Memory responses if subjective memory is correlated with objective memory).
To manipulate CS attitude, the most valent (positive and negative) CS stimuli were used; they were not paired with USs during learning.
For these stimuli, Attitude responses should reflect pre-rated attitudes. 

Mirroring the original PD procedure, in addition to the modified inclusion instruction we also implemented a modified variant of the attitude-exclusion instruction. 
The exclusion condition is not required by the modified PD procedure but serves to assess the invariance assumption of the PD approach.
Figure \@ref(fig:modPD1) gives an overview of the experimental procedure.

(ref:modPD1-caption) Exp. 1 (N=120) had a 2 x 2 x 2 design (repeated measures on the last two factors): Modified-PD instruction (inclusion vs. attitude-exclusion) x Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired). The 24 most neutrally pre-rated face stimuli (for a given participant) were selected as neutral CSs (12 were paired with positive USs, and 12 with negative USs); the 16 most extremely rated ones (8 positive, 8 negative) were used as valenced control CSs. USs were IAPS images; each CS was paired during learning with 8 different USs of the same valence. After learning, memory and attitudes were assessed (modified PD procedure, evaluative ratings, US valence memory, US identity memory).

## Method

The study was registered prior to data collection and analysis (see osf.io/rkb3w).
^[For both studies, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.]
Materials, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/b8w9j [@stahl_moving_2020].

### Participants and Design

The study realizes a 2 x 2 x 2 design with repeated measures on the last two factors: 
Modified-PD instruction (inclusion vs. attitude-exclusion) x Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired). 
We collected a sample of N=120 participants (60 per instruction condition), as this is approximately 2-3x the sample size recruited by @hutter_dissociating_2012 as recommended by the rule of thumb for replications by @simonsohn_small_2015.

### Materials and Procedure

We used the same materials as @hutter_dissociating_2012: 
A set of photographic images of faces served as CSs; a set of IAPS images served as USs. 
The face CSs were pre-rated by participants by positioning a cursor on a slider ranging from 'very unpleasant' (-100) to 'very pleasant' (+100). 
Of these faces, the 24 most neutrally pre-rated ones served as critical CSs (i.e., 12 paired with positive USs, 12 with negative USs). 
The 16 most extremely pre-rated faces (8 of each valence) were not presented during the learning phase but served as valent control stimuli. 
During learning, the 24 critical CSs were repeatedly paired with USs (i.e., each CS was presented once with one of 8 USs of the same valence). 
Dependent measures were collected for all 40 CS stimuli (i.e., the two sets of 24 critical/paired and 16 control/nonpaired face photographs).

<!-- 24 neutral CSs, each paired with 8 different USs: 192 different pairs -->
<!-- 100 USs (50 pos, 50 neg), each paired with about 2 different CSs -->

First, participants pre-rated all 120 face stimuli.
In the subsequent learning phase, CS and US images were presented side by side on the computer screen (positions were randomly selected for each trial).
After learning, memory and attitude were assessed for all 40 CSs. 
The modified PD procedure was implemented first. 
After PD instructions were given, instruction understanding was tested:
Participants were presented with descriptions of the 8 possible combinations of memory and attitude states (one for each possible case), and were asked to select the corresponding response according to PD instructions.
PD was followed by post-learning evaluative ratings.
Finally, memory for US valence and US identity were assessed:
Participants were asked to indicate (successively for each CS) whether it had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs; they could also report that they "don't know" the correct response.
When assessing participants' US identity memory, we presented them with a set of 16 US images for a given CS, and asked them to select any one of the eight that had been paired with that CS during learning.

# Experiment 2

Experiment 2 examined the robustness of the findings from Experiment 1 and extends it in several ways:
First, memory and attitudes were manipulated in a fully orthogonal within-subjects design by independently varying CS valence (positive, neutral, negative) and US valence (positive, non-paired, negative).
Second, new US material was used, and CS Material (human faces vs. toy figures) was additionally varied between subjects (this was done for generalization purposes; we did not expect any effects).
Third, we added more established subjective memory measures:
<!-- confidence rating and Remember-Know-Guess judgments:  -->
Departing from Experiment 1, US valence memory was assessed here using a 6-point confidence scale (ranging from "sure unpleasant" to "sure pleasant") as well as a remember/know/guess (RKG) judgment task.
To control for carry-over effects from the PD task, a third (no-PD) group of participants skipped the PD procedure and worked only on the other memory measures.


(ref:modPD2-caption) Experiment 2 had a 3 (Modified-PD response format: Inclusion, Exclusion, Control) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). Pre-ratings of CS pleasantness were followed by the learning phase, in which participants viewed CS-US pairs. After learning, the modified PD task was implemented first (in either the Inclusion or Exclusion conditions; the no-PD group skipped this task). Evaluative ratings were then collected; and US valence memory was assessed (confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess ratings). US-identity memory was assessed last (4 of 8 USs options were foils).

knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/ecopd-procedure-2.jpg")
```

## Method

The procedure of the preregistered Experiment 2 (osf.io/3mgvk) is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:modPD2).
Material, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/b8w9j.


### Participants

We again aimed for $N=120$ participants (i.e., 20 in each of the six groups); after the final day of data collection a total of $N=123$ had participated.
As in @hutter_dissociating_2012, but deviating from Exp. 1, participants ($n=13$) were excluded who failed to correctly implement the PD instructions even after reading them for the third time. 
The final sample consisted of $N=110$ participants ($n_{Inclusion}=36, n_{Exclusion}=34, n_{Control}=40$).

### Design 

Participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (*PD Instruction*: Inclusion vs. Exclusion vs. Control) x 2 (*Material*: human faces vs. toy figures) between-subject design.
Within subjects, *US Valence* (positive, neutral/non-paired, negative) and *CS Valence* (positive, neutral, negative), were manipulated orthogonally.

### Material

As in Experiment 1, images of faces were used as CSs (deviating from Exp.1, we selected only the first 100 from the set of 120 images).
As additional CSs, we used 100 photographs of toy figures (*Gogo Crazy Bones*).
As USs, we used 112 color images from the OASIS database [@kurdi_introducing_2017; 56 positive and 56 negative, with comparable arousal ratings].
For a given participant, the most neutrally pre-rated 24 faces or toys as well as the 18 most valent faces or toys (9 positive, 9 negative) served as CSs.
Of the 24 neutral CSs, 16 were paired with USs (8 positive, 8 negative).
Of the initially valent CSs, 3 from each valence were paired with USs of each valence (i.e., 3 initially positive as well as 3 initially negative CSs were paired with positive USs; the other 3 from each valence set were paired with negative USs).
The remaining 8 neutral CSs, together with 3 positive and 3 negative CSs, comprised the set of 14 non-paired control CSs.
A set of four different USs was randomly assigned to and uniquely paired with each CS; each US was paired twice with that CS.
Where possible, dependent measures were collected for all 42 CSs; US identity memory was not assessed for non-paired CSs.


<!-- CS: | pos US | no US | neg US -->
<!-- ----|-------|-------|-------- -->
<!-- pos | 3 | 3 | 3 -->
<!-- neu | 8 | 8 | 8 -->
<!-- neg | 3 | 3 | 3 -->

### Procedure

The procedure closely followed that of Experiment 1 (and, therefore, of the @hutter_dissociating_2012 studies).
Deviating from Experiment 1, evaluative ratings were collected on a 20-point (instead of 200-point) scale.
In addition, memory for US valence was assessed as follows:
We presented CSs as cues and asked participants to indicate the valence of the paired USs on a 6-point scale ranging from "sure positive" to "sure negative".
Immediately following their response, they were asked to introspect the basis of their response and indicate whether they (1) remembered the pairing, (2) knew the answer, or (3) guessed.
The instructions for these ratings were adapted from @wais_remember-know_2008.
As a final deviation from the procedure of Experiment 1, participants were not given a *don't know* response option in the US identity memory test to parallel the absence of such an option in the US valence memory test; instead, in case of uncertainty, they were instructed to guess.

#  Exploring the potential of response-level subjective memory measures in EC research

So far, we have addressed the first two goals: 
Establishing a modified PD procedure that renders subjective memory experiences observable at the response level, and using it to empirically investigate the assumptions underlying the PD approach.  
This section addresses our third goal: 
To illustrate how an response-level measurement approach can yield rich result patterns that help move EC research forward.

Three example analyses sketch how a joint analysis of multiple fine-grained measures can go beyond group-level point estimates.
First, we explored the relation between the several subjective measures and their validity as proxies of objective memory indicators.
Second, we explored EC effects as a function of subjective and objective memory indicators. 
Third, we analyzed responses to non-paired items to explore heuristics proposed to underlie the strong memory-evaluation correlation in EC.

## Summary and Discussion

In three examples, we sketched how the joint use of response-level measures, such as confidence ratings or Remember-Know-Guess judgments may benefit EC research.

We first assessed the relation between subjective and objective memory measures.
Limiting their usefulness, individual subjective indices of valence memory were noisy proxies of valence-memory accuracy and subject to regression to the mean artifacts. 
Low levels of subjective memory did not reliably indicate the absence of objective memory.
Yet, there was also support for their validity as proxies for objective memory: 
Subjective valence-memory measures were more strongly correlated with valence- than identity-memory accuracy; and "knowing" US valence was associated with valence- (but not identity-) memory accuracy, whereas "remembering" the pairing was associated with (both valence- and) identity-memory accuracy.

Next, we explored their relations with EC.
Replicating previous findings, EC was restricted to cases with accurate valence-memory responses [@stahl_respective_2009].
Also replicating previous findings [@waroquier_distinguishing_2020], an EC effect was found for the lowest levels of subjective memory (e.g., low-confidence/Guess responses), although its interpretation is complicated by selection-bias issues.
When considered jointly, EC was found to increase with subjective memory only for accurate valence-memory responses. 
For inaccurate valence-memory responses, regular EC was absent across all levels of subjective memory; but an inverted EC effect was found for high levels of subjective memory.

Third, to better understand what underlies the reversed EC effect, we explored responses to nonpaired stimuli.
Pre-post evaluative changes were associated with valence-memory responses, and this was moderated by confidence.
This effect was analogous to the inverted-EC effect obtained for paired stimuli, which was also modulated by subjective memory (and evident only for high-confidence/R responses); it may reflect an influence of *perceived US valence* on evaluations.
In contrast to the predictions of an attitude-as-information heuristic (which implies a modulation by confidence), the association valence-memory responses and evaluations was found to be unmodulated by confidence.

The above analyses extend previous work to show that---and how---EC effects vary as a joint function of objective and subjective memory. 
In three examples, using and combining fine-grained measures has yielded much richer data that helped uncover novel patterns.
Within this approach, subjective memory measures have been useful (not when taking their responses at face value, but) in helping to highlight regularities.
