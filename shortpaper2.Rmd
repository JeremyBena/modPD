# Introduction

A central issue in both learning and attitude research has been the role of awareness in evaluative learning.
Dual-learning models of attitudes have long posited the existence of an associative learning pathway through which attitudes are unconsciously acquired [@gawronski_associative-propositional_2014].
The empirical investigation of this question has mostly relied on the evaluative conditioning (EC) paradigm [@sweldens_role_2014].
In this paradigm, a (neutral) conditioned stimulus (CS) typically elicits positive (vs. negative) evaluations after being paired with a positive (vs. negative) unconditional affective stimulus (US).
The issue at stake is whether such evaluative effects occur in the absence of participants' awareness of the CS-US pairings.

The role of awareness in EC has been studied using both experimental and correlational approaches.
Experimental studies have manipulated participants' capacity to encode CS-US pairings in memory.
This was done using a variety of procedures implemented at learning, including brief and masked presentation [@heycke_subliminal_2017; @heycke_two_2018], continuous flash suppression [@hogden_does_2018], parafoveal exposure [@dedonder_overcoming_2013] or by limiting participant's attentional resources using dual-tasks at learning [@dedonder_evaluative_2010, @kattner_revisiting_2012, @pleyers_evaluative_2009]. The results suggest that EC effects do not arise in the absence of awareness at encoding, that they require cognitive ressources [@mierop_cognitive_2020], and generally may not arise in a way that is consistent with associative principles posited by dual-learning models of attitudes [for a comprehensive review, see @corneille_associative_2019].

A second, correlational, line of research used memory measures obtained after learning as a proxy for awareness of CS-US pairings at encoding, and related these measures to EC effects.
Some of these studies have supported the view that EC effects can be found in the absence of CS-US memory [e.g., @hutter_dissociating_2012, @hutter_sweldens_2013].
Such demonstrations, however, do not necessarily speak to the role of awareness in attitude *formation* (e.g., because the finding of EC without memory may be explained by partial forgetting).
Instead, they address the role of awareness in attitude *expression*, and may inform the role of choice memory states in the persistence of EC effects [@corneille_associative_2019, @gawronski_what_2012, @sweldens_role_2014].
Whether EC effects can persist in the absence of memory for CS-US pairing episodes is an important question in its own right:
Retrospective assessments, although not interpretable as measures of awareness at learning, are relevant for both theoretical issues (e.g., the question whether single vs. dual representations underlie evaluative and memory judgments) and applied issues (e.g., whether and how evaluative responses can be controlled as a function of their source).

Assessments of awareness or memory are most informative and relevant if they meet certain criteria [@shanks_1994]. 
Amongst those criteria is the requirement that they measure the information that is critical in producing the effect in question. 
To consciously produce an EC effect, one must remember the valence of the specific US(s) that has been paired with a given CS. 
The criterion is therefore ideally met by assessments that are made at the level of the specific CS item (as opposed to aggregating across items and classifying participants as aware or unaware), as has been argued by @pleyers_2007; and that focus on memory for US valence (instead of, e.g., the ability to discriminate the US from other USs of the same valence) as does the valence-memory assessment proposed by @stahl_respective_2009 which asks participants to indicate, for each CS, whether it had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs.

However, this measure, by jointly meeting both of these criteria, becomes susceptible to a bias based on attitude-as-information [@hutter_dissociating_2012; @bar-anan_etal].
Specifically, when they lack memory but are nevertheless asked to select either of the "pleasant" or "unpleasant" responses, participants may respond on the basis on their feelings toward the CS (e.g., "the CS feels pleasant, so it must have been paired with positive USs").
Participants would tend to respond "pleasant USs" in response to pleasant CSs, and this response pattern would then be falsely interpreted as indicating that the EC effect was accompanied by CS-US contingency memory.
Thus, the heuristic would mask truly unaware EC effects (if such effects exist), falsely suggesting that they are accompanied by memory for US valence.
As a consequence, when forcing participants to guess, it may become impossible to obtain evidence in favor of dual-process accounts using CS-level valence-memory tasks.

Two assessment procedures have been proposed that avoid forcing participants to guess [@stahl_respective_2009, @hutter_dissociating_2012].
Both tasks rely on participants' judgments about whether or not they remember US valence: Only if they feel they do are they asked to indicate which US valence (pleasant or unpleasant) they remember.
Both procedures thereby avoid pressuring participants into reporting a memory they do not feel confident about, and thereby address the attitude-as-information problem.
Yet, each of these two procedures comes with its specific limitation (discussed below); for this reason, here we introduce and experimentally validate a novel task that combines the advantages (and eliminates the limitations) of these two procedures.
We furthermore combine the novel tasks with established memory measures to obtain a richer result pattern and to better understand the processes resulting in memory-evaluation correlations.

## A simple procedure for the assessment of memory for US valence

To follow up on @pleyers_2007' argument that, to optimize the information criterion, awareness should be assessed at the level of the individual CS-US pair, @stahl_respective_2009 assessed which features of the US participants would need to remember to produce EC effects.
They used a two-stage memory task: 
It asked participants to indicate, first, whether a given CS had been paired with pleasant or unpleasant US images; to respond correctly at this stage, participants need to remember only the US's valence.
At a second stage, participants were presented with a set of US images of the same valence as the correct US, only one of which had indeed paired with the CS; to select the correct US, participants need to remember not only US valence but at least one identifying feature.
They found that the first-stage data (i.e., memory for US valence) predicted the EC effect, and that the data from the second stage (i.e., memory for US identity) did not add to that prediction.
In short, memory for US valence was found to be necessary for EC.
The valence-memory task was then expanded to also include a third, "I don't know", option that allowed participants to report their lack of memory and avoided the need to resort to heuristics; and the self-reported EC effects were complemented by affective-priming measures. 
Consistently across three experiments, an EC effect on both measures was found only when participants correctly remembered US valence. 
No EC effects were found with incorrect memory reports, nor when participants reported not remembering US valence.
^[In one study, an inverted (or negative) EC effect was found on the self-report but not the affective-priming index, it is discussed below in more detail.]



## A process-dissociation procedure for separating US valence memory from evaluations in the absence of memory

A second approach to addressing the attitude-as-information heuristic was aimed at separating participants' explicit memory for US valence from their attitude towards the CS in the absence of such explicit memory [@hutter_dissociating_2012].
For each CS, participants indicate 
<!-- A trial of this PD procedure (illustrated in Fig. \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)) presents participants with a CS and asks them to indicate  -->
(1) whether the CS had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs (by selecting either the "pleasant" or "unpleasant" response); or, if participants cannot remember the valence of the US, they indicate (2) whether they find the CS pleasant or unpleasant (via the same "pleasant" or "unpleasant" responses; Figure \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)).
Participants thus perform a two-stage task:
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not.
The outcome of this decision determines how to proceed in the second stage---report the memory judgment from the first stage (if they remember US valence); or perform and report an attitude judgment (if they don't remember US valence).

Importantly, participants do not indicate the outcome of their decision in any way, so that the researcher has no way to tell whether the given participant remembered the specific CS-US pair or not; the data become informative only after they are aggregated across trials and participants, and compared across two conditions based on a process-dissociation (PD) logic.
The PD procedure was originally developed by Jacoby [@jacoby_process_1991; for review see @yonelinas_processdissociation_2012] to separate explicit and implicit memory.
Instead of assuming the existence of process-pure "explicit" and "implicit" tasks, he acknowledged that each task may involve both implicit and explicit processes.
The PD procedure aimed at separating the contribution of two latent processes by contrasting, within the same task, performance under two different instruction conditions:
Under *inclusion* instructions, the two latent processes lead to the same response, whereas under *exclusion* instructions, they are assumed to oppose each other.
Given that certain assumptions hold, a joint analysis of the responses under the inclusion and exclusion instructions allows estimating the separate contributions of the two latent processes.

(ref:PD-inclusion) PD instructions (left: Inclusion; right: Exclusion). Participants engage in a two-stage task: First, they determine whether they remember US valence or not. If they remember US valence, they report their memory judgment; if they do not remember US valence, they report an attitude judgment.

```{r PD-inclusion, fig.cap="(ref:PD-inclusion)", fig.env = "figure*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/figure1_suggestion.jpg")
```

According to the approach by Hütter et al., the two-stage task is performed under one of two different instruction conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)): 
Under the *inclusion* instructions participants are asked to faithfully report their attitude towards the CS.
<!-- Participants' response pattern when reporting their memory of US valence is the same when they remember the US valence and when they do not remember it but instead have acquired an attitude towards the CS that persists in the absence of remembering. -->
Here, participants give the same response when they accurately remember the US's valence and when they have acquired an attitude towards the CS via its pairing with the US but do not remember the US's valence.
Hence, the observed responses under inclusion instructions alone cannot separate the two processes as they converge in identical response patterns; an additional condition is required in which the two processes produce opposite response patterns.
<!-- Hence, the data from the inclusion condition are not sufficient for separating the two processes as they converge in identical responses; an additional condition is required under which the two processes are associated with different response patterns. -->

Placing memory and attitude judgments in opposition is achieved by giving
<!-- This is achieved by having another group of participants performing the task under  -->
*exclusion* instructions to another group of participants.
^[The original article introduced two versions of the exclusion condition (memory-exclusion and attitude-exclusion). Here we limit the discussion to the more widely-used "attitude-exclusion" condition.]
Participants again perform the two-stage task: 
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not; then, conditional on their decision, they report either the memory or attitude judgments (i.e., the memory judgment if they remember; the attitude judgment if they don't).
Under exclusion instructions, however, participants have to reverse the response mapping of the attitude judgment:
If participants find the CS pleasant, they need to respond "unpleasant"; conversely, if they find the CS unpleasant they are instructed to respond "pleasant".
<!-- Under exclusion instructions, however, the response mapping of the attitude judgment has to be reversed: a "pleasant" judgment has to be reported via the "unpleasant" response, whereas an "unpleasant" judgment has to be reported via the "pleasant" response. -->

<!-- ### parameter “m” as “the probability that a participant has explicit US valence memory” -->

The response frequencies obtained in this procedure are aggregated across items and persons for analysis and can be expressed as the proportion of "pleasant" reports in each of the four cells of the *US Valence* (positive vs. negative) by *PD Instruction* (inclusion vs. exclusion) design.
These proportions are used to obtain group-level estimates of three latent parameters via the equations of a multinomial processing-tree (MPT) model: *M* (interpreted as the probability of remembering US valence), *A* (interpreted as the probability of having an attitude in the absence of US valence memory), and *R* (reflecting the probability of responding "pleasant" in the presumed absence of either memory or attitude; this third parameter is often coined "guessing" or "response bias").

<!-- TODO: add footnote with model equations  -->
In support of the validity of the PD approach, estimates of these parameters were affected in a plausible manner by selective-influence validation manipulations (i.e., pre-existing attitudes were reflected in the *A* parameter as expected; and forgetting over time reduced only the *M* but not the *A* parameter). The MPT model fitted the data of most published studies well [e.g., @hutter_dissociating_2012].
<!-- In sum, to assess the role of awareness in evaluative learning, the PD procedure aims at providing an estimate of EC in the absence of memory for US valence. -->
Estimates of the A parameter that deviate from zero (i.e., A>0) are interpreted as evidence for EC that persists in the absence of explicit US valence memory.
A recent meta-analysis across 12 PD studies [@mierop_does_2018] yielded an overall mean estimate of *A*=.07, 95% CI [.04, .11].
<!--Put differently, EC was found for approximately 7% *of those CSs for which no memory was present, are estimated to show EC effects in the absence of memory for US valence.-->
The meta-analysis also revealed substantial heterogeneity (I² = 56%), reflecting the fact that the confidence interval of *A* excluded zero in 5 out of 12 studies, but included zero in the remaining 7 studies.
Briefly, although the effect appears to be small (and perhaps contingent on unknown enabling conditions), PD studies yield initial meta-analytic evidence for the persistence of EC effects in the absence of US-valence memory.


## A novel procedure for assessing US valence memory and evaluations

### intro, description, figure

### summary

The proposed novel procedure is highly similar to the unforced-choice valence-memory task and even more so to the PD task. 
The difference to the UCVM task is that in the absence of memory, an evaluative judgment is made (thereby addressing the UCVM task's limitation); the difference to the PD task is that the 'remember' judgment is observable (thereby addressing the PD task's limitation).

To empirically support the new procedure in a manner comparable to that of the two established ones, we report below two studies assessing its validity.
To do so, the studies varied whether a CS was paired with a US or not, hence manipulating US memory. 
They also varied whether a CS was neutral or valenced, thereby manipulating CS attitudes. 
We assessed whether the memory manipulations were adequately reflected in the proportion of 'remember' responses, and whether the attitude manipulations were adequately reflected in CS evaluations in the absence of memory.

## 'Remember' reports, confidence, and accuracy

The above procedures - the established ones as well as the new one - rely on participants' ability to determine whether they 'remember US valence' or not.
In other words, whether a participant reports her memory or evaluation of a given CS is determined by her introspective mnemonic decision "I (don't) remember US valence for this CS" (a decision that may involve placing a criterion on a continuum of evidence); it is not directly reflective of whether (or not) she has in her mind a certain amount of mnemonic evidence, or that she can indeed accurately report US valence (or not).
It is therefore likely that some participants, for some CSs, will falsely report having no memory when they in fact have substantial mnemonic evidence of the US's valence; in other cases, they will erroneously report what they confidently consider to be an accurate memory when they in fact don't recall US valence. 
Such cases of discrepancy between participants' introspective mnemonic decisions and their memory performance may help illuminate the processes underlying mnemonic and evaluative judgments.
In addition to validating the novel procedure, we will therefore study the role of memory confidence and accuracy in the correlation between mnemonic and evaluative judgments.
In particular, we were interested in whether the finding of an inverted or negative EC effect is associated with low confidence (as would be predicted if it reflects a heuristic used in the absence of memory), or with high confidence (as would be predicted if it reflected high-confidence false memories).


# Methods

# Experiment 1

Experiment 1 probes the validity of the modified PD by manipulating both CS-US pairing memory and CS attitudes (within subjects) to test whether the manipulations selectively affect the Memory and Attitude responses.
CSs were selected individually on the basis of a given participant's pre-study ratings.
To manipulate pairing memory, neutrally pre-rated CSs were paired with USs during learning.
This should affect the frequency of subjective Memory responses (as well as the accuracy of the Memory responses if subjective memory is correlated with objective memory).
To manipulate CS attitude, the most valent (positive and negative) CS stimuli were used; they were not paired with USs during learning.
For these stimuli, Attitude responses should reflect pre-rated attitudes.

Mirroring the original PD procedure, in addition to the modified inclusion instruction we also implemented a modified variant of the attitude-exclusion instruction.
The exclusion condition is not required by the modified PD procedure but serves to assess the invariance assumption of the PD approach.
Figure \@ref(fig:modPD1) gives an overview of the experimental procedure.

(ref:modPD1-caption) Exp. 1 (N=120) had a 2 x 2 x 2 design (repeated measures on the last two factors): Modified-PD instruction (inclusion vs. attitude-exclusion) x Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired). The 24 most neutrally pre-rated face stimuli (for a given participant) were selected as neutral CSs (12 were paired with positive USs, and 12 with negative USs); the 16 most extremely rated ones (8 positive, 8 negative) were used as valenced control CSs. USs were IAPS images; each CS was paired during learning with 8 different USs of the same valence. After learning, memory and attitudes were assessed (modified PD procedure, evaluative ratings, US valence memory, US identity memory).

```

## Method

The study was registered prior to data collection and analysis (see osf.io/rkb3w).
[^1] Materials, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/b8w9j [@stahl_moving_2020].

[^1]: For both studies, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.

### Participants and Design

The study realizes a 2 x 2 x 2 design with repeated measures on the last two factors: Modified-PD instruction (inclusion vs. attitude-exclusion) x Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired).
We collected a sample of N=120 participants (60 per instruction condition), as this is approximately 2-3x the sample size recruited by @hutter_dissociating_2012 as recommended by the rule of thumb for replications by @simonsohn_small_2015.

### Materials and Procedure

We used the same materials as @hutter_dissociating_2012: A set of photographic images of faces served as CSs; a set of IAPS images served as USs.
The face CSs were pre-rated by participants by positioning a cursor on a slider ranging from 'very unpleasant' (-100) to 'very pleasant' (+100).
Of these faces, the 24 most neutrally pre-rated ones served as critical CSs (i.e., 12 paired with positive USs, 12 with negative USs).
The 16 most extremely pre-rated faces (8 of each valence) were not presented during the learning phase but served as valent control stimuli.
During learning, the 24 critical CSs were repeatedly paired with USs (i.e., each CS was presented once with one of 8 USs of the same valence).
Dependent measures were collected for all 40 CS stimuli (i.e., the two sets of 24 critical/paired and 16 control/nonpaired face photographs).

First, participants pre-rated all 120 face stimuli.
In the subsequent learning phase, CS and US images were presented side by side on the computer screen (positions were randomly selected for each trial).
After learning, memory and attitude were assessed for all 40 CSs.
The modified PD procedure was implemented first.
After PD instructions were given, instruction understanding was tested: Participants were presented with descriptions of the 8 possible combinations of memory and attitude states (one for each possible case), and were asked to select the corresponding response according to PD instructions.
PD was followed by post-learning evaluative ratings.
Finally, memory for US valence and US identity were assessed: Participants were asked to indicate (successively for each CS) whether it had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs; they could also report that they "don't know" the correct response.
When assessing participants' US identity memory, we presented them with a set of 16 US images for a given CS, and asked them to select any one of the eight that had been paired with that CS during learning.

# Experiment 2

Experiment 2 examined the robustness of the findings from Experiment 1 and extends it in several ways: First, memory and attitudes were manipulated in a fully orthogonal within-subjects design by independently varying CS valence (positive, neutral, negative) and US valence (positive, non-paired, negative).
Second, new US material was used, and CS Material (human faces vs. toy figures) was additionally varied between subjects (this was done for generalization purposes; we did not expect any effects).
Third, we added more established subjective memory measures: <!-- confidence rating and Remember-Know-Guess judgments:  --> Departing from Experiment 1, US valence memory was assessed here using a 6-point confidence scale (ranging from "sure unpleasant" to "sure pleasant") as well as a remember/know/guess (RKG) judgment task.
To control for carry-over effects from the PD task, a third (no-PD) group of participants skipped the PD procedure and worked only on the other memory measures.

(ref:modPD2-caption) Experiment 2 had a 3 (Modified-PD response format: Inclusion, Exclusion, Control) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). Pre-ratings of CS pleasantness were followed by the learning phase, in which participants viewed CS-US pairs. After learning, the modified PD task was implemented first (in either the Inclusion or Exclusion conditions; the no-PD group skipped this task). Evaluative ratings were then collected; and US valence memory was assessed (confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess ratings). US-identity memory was assessed last (4 of 8 USs options were foils).

knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/ecopd-procedure-2.jpg")
```

## Method

The procedure of the preregistered Experiment 2 (osf.io/3mgvk) is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:modPD2).
Material, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/b8w9j.

### Participants

We again aimed for $N=120$ participants (i.e., 20 in each of the six groups); after the final day of data collection a total of $N=123$ had participated.
As in @hutter_dissociating_2012, but deviating from Exp. 1, participants ($n=13$) were excluded who failed to correctly implement the PD instructions even after reading them for the third time.
The final sample consisted of $N=110$ participants ($n_{Inclusion}=36, n_{Exclusion}=34, n_{Control}=40$).

### Design

Participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (*PD Instruction*: Inclusion vs. Exclusion vs. Control) x 2 (*Material*: human faces vs. toy figures) between-subject design.
Within subjects, *US Valence* (positive, neutral/non-paired, negative) and *CS Valence* (positive, neutral, negative), were manipulated orthogonally.

### Material

As in Experiment 1, images of faces were used as CSs (deviating from Exp.1, we selected only the first 100 from the set of 120 images).
As additional CSs, we used 100 photographs of toy figures (*Gogo Crazy Bones*).
As USs, we used 112 color images from the OASIS database \[@kurdi_introducing_2017; 56 positive and 56 negative, with comparable arousal ratings\].
For a given participant, the most neutrally pre-rated 24 faces or toys as well as the 18 most valent faces or toys (9 positive, 9 negative) served as CSs.
Of the 24 neutral CSs, 16 were paired with USs (8 positive, 8 negative).
Of the initially valent CSs, 3 from each valence were paired with USs of each valence (i.e., 3 initially positive as well as 3 initially negative CSs were paired with positive USs; the other 3 from each valence set were paired with negative USs).
The remaining 8 neutral CSs, together with 3 positive and 3 negative CSs, comprised the set of 14 non-paired control CSs.
A set of four different USs was randomly assigned to and uniquely paired with each CS; each US was paired twice with that CS.
Where possible, dependent measures were collected for all 42 CSs; US identity memory was not assessed for non-paired CSs.

### Procedure

The procedure closely followed that of Experiment 1 (and, therefore, of the @hutter_dissociating_2012 studies).
Deviating from Experiment 1, evaluative ratings were collected on a 20-point (instead of 200-point) scale.
In addition, memory for US valence was assessed as follows: We presented CSs as cues and asked participants to indicate the valence of the paired USs on a 6-point scale ranging from "sure positive" to "sure negative".
Immediately following their response, they were asked to introspect the basis of their response and indicate whether they (1) remembered the pairing, (2) knew the answer, or (3) guessed.
The instructions for these ratings were adapted from @wais_remember-know_2008.
As a final deviation from the procedure of Experiment 1, participants were not given a *don't know* response option in the US identity memory test to parallel the absence of such an option in the US valence memory test; instead, in case of uncertainty, they were instructed to guess.
