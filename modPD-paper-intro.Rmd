<!-- ## Introduction -->

Dual-learning models of attitudes have long posited the existence of an associative learning pathway through which attitudes are unconsciously acquired [@rydell_two_2006;@gawronski_associative-propositional_2014]. 
The empirical investigation of this question has mostly relied on the evaluative conditioning (EC) paradigm [@sweldens_role_2014]. 
In this paradigm, a (neutral) conditioned stimulus (CS) typically elicits positive (vs. negative) evaluations after being paired with a positive (vs. negative) unconditional affective stimulus (US). 
The associative structure of the EC paradigm, as well as its simplicity, made it a relevant candidate for supporting associative learning assumptions, including unconscious learning, as posited by dual-learning models of attitudes.

Research on the role of awareness in EC has relied on both experimental and correlational approaches. 
Experimental studies have manipulated participants’ capacity to encode CS-US pairings in memory. 
This was done using a variety of procedures implemented at learning, including brief and masked presentation [@heycke_subliminal_2017;@heycke_two_2018] <!-- (e.g., Stahl, Haaf & Corneille, 2016, Heycke, Aust, & Stahl, 2017; Heycke, Gehrmann, Haaf, & Stahl, 2018) -->, continuous flash suppression [@hogden_does_2018]<!-- (Hodgen, Hütter, & Unkelbach, 2017) -->, parafoveal exposure [@dedonder_overcoming_2013]
<!-- (e.g., Dedonder, Corneille, Bertinchamps, & Yzerbyt, 2014) -->
or by limiting participant’s attentional resources using dual-tasks at learning 
[@dedonder_evaluative_2010; @kattner_revisiting_2012; @pleyers_evaluative_2009].
<!-- (e.g., Dedonder, Corneille, Yzerbyt, & Kuppens, 2010; Kattner, 2012; Pleyers, Corneille, Yzerbyt, & Luminet, 2009).  -->
This experimental research suggests that EC effects do not arise in the absence of awareness at encoding, that they require cognitive ressources [@mierop_cognitive_2020], and generally may not arise in a way that is consistent with associative principles posited by dual-learning models of attitudes [for a comprehensive review, see @corneille_associative_2019].

A second, correlational, line of research seemingly reached opposite conclusions regarding unconscious attitude learning. 
Here, instead of manipulating awareness during learning, the rationale was to use memory measures obtained after learning as a proxy for awareness of CS-US pairings at encoding, and to relate these measures to EC effects. 
These studies have supported the view that EC effects can be found in the absence of CS-US memory. 
This demonstration, however, does not necessarily speak to the role of awareness in attitude *formation*. 
Instead, it addresses the role of memory states in the persistence of EC effects [@corneille_associative_2019; @gawronski_what_2012; @sweldens_role_2014]. 
Whether EC effects can persist in the absence of memory for CS-US pairing episodes, however, is an important question in its own right. 
Here we introduce a more refined approach to addressing this question than those that currently exist.


This article is organized into four main sections. 
In a first section (Section I: “The PD procedure as a tool for isolating memory-independent EC”), we discuss the strongest currently available approach to study the role of memory states in EC:

In the second section (Section II: “Introducing a modified PD procedure to overcome limitations of the original PD approach”), we introduce an alternative procedure, the modified PD, for assessing subjective memory.
We explain how this new procedure overcomes important limitations associated with the original PD approach.

In a third, empirical, section (Section III: “Empirical section”), we report two experiments that validate our modified PD procedure.
In doing so, we report evidence (i) that contradicts assumptions of the original PD procedure, and (ii) that illustrates the usefulness of more fine-grained measures of attitude and (objective as well as subjective) memory states.

We summarize the main findings and discuss them in the broader context of attitude research in the fourth section, the General Discussion.

# I. The PD procedure as a tool for isolating memory-independent EC

In this section, we first provide a brief overview of the original PD procedure. 
Next, we explain that the original PD conflates subjective and objective memory states. 
Finally, we argue that three critical assumptions of the PD procedure (the perfect-introspection assumption, the invariance assumption, and the independence assumptions) are likely violated and we explain why this is problematic for a valid interpretation of the parameters generated by this approach. 
This sets the stage for Section II, where we introduce our modified PD procedure.

### An overview of the original PD

<!-- ### logic -->

The PD procedure was originally developed by Jacoby [@jacoby_process_1991; for review see @yonelinas_processdissociation_2012] to separate explicit and implicit memory.
Instead of assuming the existence of process-pure "explicit" and "implicit" tasks, he acknowledged that each task may involve both implicit and explicit processes.
The PD procedure aimed at separating the contribution of two latent processes by contrasting, within the same task, performance under two different instruction conditions:
Under *inclusion* instructions, the two latent processes lead to the same response, whereas under *exclusion* instructions, they are assumed to oppose each other.
Given that certain assumptions hold, a joint analysis of the responses under the inclusion and exclusion instructions allows estimating the separate contributions of the two latent processes.

<!-- ### describe procedure -->

When applied to evaluative conditioning, the PD procedure is used to separate participants' explicit memory for US valence from their attitude towards the CS in the absence of such explicit memory [@hutter_dissociating_2012].
For each CS, participants indicate 
<!-- A trial of this PD procedure (illustrated in Fig. \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)) presents participants with a CS and asks them to indicate  -->
(1) whether the CS had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs (by selecting either the "pleasant" or "unpleasant" response); or, if participants cannot remember the valence of the US, they indicate (2) whether they find the CS pleasant or unpleasant (via the same "pleasant" or "unpleasant" responses; Figure \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)).
Participants thus perform a two-stage task:
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not.
The outcome of this decision determines how to proceed in the second stage---report the memory judgment from the first stage (if they remember US valence); or perform and report an attitude judgment (if they don't remember US valence).

(ref:PD-inclusion) PD instructions (left: Inclusion; right: Exclusion). Participants engage in a two-stage task: First, they determine whether they remember US valence or not. If they remember US valence, they report their memory judgment; if they do not remember US valence, they report an attitude judgment.
 

```{r PD-inclusion, fig.cap="(ref:PD-inclusion)", fig.env = "figure*", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/figure1_suggestion.jpg")
```

This two-stage task is performed under one of two different instruction conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:PD-inclusion)): 
Under the *inclusion* instructions participants are asked to faithfully report their attitude towards the CS.
<!-- Participants' response pattern when reporting their memory of US valence is the same when they remember the US valence and when they do not remember it but instead have acquired an attitude towards the CS that persists in the absence of remembering. -->
Here, participants give the same response when they accurately remember the US's valence and when they have acquired an attitude towards the CS via its pairing with the US but do not remember the US's valence.
Hence, the observed responses under inclusion instructions alone cannot separate the two processes as they converge in identical response patterns; an additional condition is required in which the two processes produce opposite response patterns.
<!-- Hence, the data from the inclusion condition are not sufficient for separating the two processes as they converge in identical responses; an additional condition is required under which the two processes are associated with different response patterns. -->

Placing memory and attitude judgments in opposition is achieved by giving
<!-- This is achieved by having another group of participants performing the task under  -->
*exclusion* instructions to another group of participants.
^[The original article introduced two versions of the exclusion condition (memory-exclusion and attitude-exclusion). Here we limit the discussion to the more widely-used "attitude-exclusion" condition.]
Participants again perform the two-stage task: 
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not; then, conditional on their decision, they report either the memory or attitude judgments (i.e., the memory judgment if they remember; the attitude judgment if they don't).
Under exclusion instructions, however, participants have to reverse the response mapping of the attitude judgment:
If participants find the CS pleasant, they need to respond "unpleasant"; conversely, if they find the CS unpleasant they are instructed to respond "pleasant".
<!-- Under exclusion instructions, however, the response mapping of the attitude judgment has to be reversed: a "pleasant" judgment has to be reported via the "unpleasant" response, whereas an "unpleasant" judgment has to be reported via the "pleasant" response. -->

<!-- ### parameter “m” as “the probability that a participant has explicit US valence memory” -->

The response frequencies obtained in this procedure are aggregated across items and persons for analysis and can be expressed as the proportion of "pleasant" reports in each of the four cells of the *US Valence* (positive vs. negative) by *PD Instruction* (inclusion vs. exclusion) design.
These proportions are used to obtain group-level estimates of three latent parameters via the equations of a multinomial processing-tree (MPT) model: *M* (interpreted as the probability of remembering US valence), *A* (interpreted as the probability of having an attitude in the absence of US valence memory), and *R* (reflecting the probability of responding "pleasant" in the presumed absence of either memory or attitude; this third parameter is often coined "guessing" or "response bias"). 
<!-- TODO: add footnote with model equations  -->
In support of the validity of the PD approach, estimates of these parameters were affected in a plausible manner by selective-influence validation manipulations (i.e., pre-existing attitudes were reflected in the *A* parameter as expected; and forgetting over time reduced only the *M* but not the *A* parameter). The MPT model fitted the data of most published studies well [e.g., @hutter_dissociating_2012].

<!-- In sum, to assess the role of awareness in evaluative learning, the PD procedure aims at providing an estimate of EC in the absence of memory for US valence. -->
Estimates of the A parameter that deviate from zero (i.e., A>0) are interpreted as evidence for EC that persists in the absence of explicit US valence memory.
A recent meta-analysis across 12 PD studies [@mierop_does_2018] yielded an overall mean estimate of *A*=.07, 95% CI [.04, .11].
<!--Put differently, EC was found for approximately 7% *of those CSs for which no memory was present, are estimated to show EC effects in the absence of memory for US valence.-->
The meta-analysis also revealed substantial heterogeneity (I² = 56%), reflecting the fact that the confidence interval of *A* excluded zero in 5 out of 12 studies, but included zero in the remaining 7 studies.
Briefly, although the effect appears to be small (and perhaps contingent on unknown enabling conditions), PD studies yield initial meta-analytic evidence for the persistence of EC effects in the absence of US-valence memory.


### The PD procedure conflates subjective and objective memory states

This interpretation of the $A>0$ finding as reflecting EC without memory may, however, not be warranted.
The conclusions drawn from the PD studies rely on the assumption that participants' judgments reflect objective memory states when it actually captures subjective experiences of remembering. 
Whereas an objective memory state refers to the verifiable (un)availability of memory traces for an event (e.g., assessed as participants' accuracy in classifying probes as old or new), subjective memory states reflect participants' introspective mnemonic experiences (i.e., their feeling of (un)successful remembering).
Importantly, however, introspective experiences do not perfectly map onto objective memory states: 
A mnemonic experience of remembering an event does not imply that one has veridical memory of that event [i.e., it may well reflect subjectively compelling but false memories; e.g., @roediger_creating_1995]. 
Likewise, the lack of a subjective experience of remembering does not imply that veridical memory traces are altogether unavailable [participants can correctly classify memory probes that are not accompanied by experiences of remembering; ; e.g., @larzabal_extremely_2018; @wais_remember-know_2008].

We argue here that the PD approach [@hutter_dissociating_2012] assesses the relation of EC not with objective memory but with subjective (first-person) memory reports, or mnemonic experiences. 
Just as the PD approach uses a delayed memory assessment as a proxy for awareness during learning, it uses a subjective memory assessment as a proxy for objective memory. 
However, just as memory measures are no valid proxy for awareness during learning because there are relevant cases in which the two do not correspond 
<!-- (e.g., forgetting can lead to awareness without subsequent memory),  -->
(e.g., awareness during learning may later be forgotten),
subjective memory experiences are no valid proxy for objective memory states because there are cases in which the two do not correspond 
<!-- (e.g., a conservative subjective criterion can lead to objective memory in the absence of sufficiently strong subjective experiences of having such memory).  -->
(e.g., memory may be available despite the lack of a subjective "remember" experience).

In sum, the PD approach cannot tell us whether EC arises without awareness, nor even whether it persists without objective US valence memory;
instead, the PD approach may tell us whether EC effects persist when, subjectively, no memory of US valence is available.
This is a valuable question; yet, it should not be confused with the other two. 
Finding EC in the absence of objective memory would support dual attitude theories (to the extent that objective memory for CS-US pairings is a valid proxy for conscious encoding of these pairings).
Finding EC in the absence of subjective remembering experiences but not in the absence of objective memory, however, can be readily explained by single-process accounts.

In their introductory paper, however, Hütter et al. (2012) adopted an objective interpretation of the *A* parameter: 
The *A*>0 result is taken to reflect attitudes in the factual absence of memory.
PD was introduced as a task that dissociates the outcome of two distinct processes: "memory for the pairings" from EC "in the absence of memory" (p. 544).
Memory for US valence is assumed to be in one of two possible discrete states: It can either be present (with probability *M*) or absent (with probability 1-*M*; conditional upon its absence, an attitude towards the CS may or may not be present, as represented by parameter *A*).
It is assumed that, if participants have such memory, they will be able to detect having this memory (and they will use it to select their response).
This conflates the objective and subjective notions: 
The objective state (i.e., having memory) is equated with the subjective state of introspectively detecting such memory (and reporting it); 
in particular, the absence of a "remember" report is taken as the absence of memory.
We disagree with this assumption of a perfect match between objective and subjective states, and we will demonstrate in the next section the importance of accounting for the possibility of introspective errors.
If we allow for such errors, it follows that the PD method assesses EC in the absence (not of objective memory, but) of a subjective experience of *remembering*.

The subjective and introspective nature is easy to see from a careful analysis of the two-stage task prescribed by PD instructions:
Participants first have to decide whether they "remember" US valence or not; only after this subjective decision, they can engage in the appropriate sub-task (i.e., the memory or attitude judgment).
Importantly, there is no independent check whether participants in fact correctly recalled the pairing they claim to remember. 
In the absence of any external information or feedback, this "remember" decision must be made entirely introspectively.
Moreover, the instructions give no additional information as to how exactly that subjective decision should be made.
Participants are therefore free to apply any criteria of their choosing; put differently, they have to come up with their own criteria (this also implies that criteria are likely to vary across participants).

<!-- OC: redundant -->
In the model, it is assumed that the outcome of the introspective "remember" decision perfectly corresponds to the (presence vs. absence) of memory, and that the choice of sub-task (memory or attitude judgment) matches the assumed objective state:
A memory judgment is made only when memory is present; and an attitude judgment is made only when memory is absent---the model does not account for the possibility of failed introspection.
However, given the subjective nature of the decision, and the fact that introspection may fail, a more adequate interpretation would be that the choice of sub-task reflects the subjective state:
Participants' decision to perform the "memory" judgment indicates their introspective "remember" decision, not the actual presence of veridical US valence memory; and participants' decision to perform the attitude judgment indicates a subjective "don't remember" decision, not the actual absence of veridical US valence memory.
The subjective decision determines which of the two sub-tasks the participant engages in, and thereby, the response frequencies that come to underlie the model parameters' estimates.
In sum, the parameter estimates in fact reflect participants' subjective assessment of whether or not they *remember*; they do not inform us about whether or not they indeed have veridical memory.
The above description shows that the PD procedure does not rely on an objective assessment of participants' memory.
Instead, the procedure calls for an introspective (i.e., subjective) decision about participants’
mnemonic state---whether they somehow feel they *remember* or not.
This subjective nature of the PD poses problems for an objective interpretation of its results, as we will illustrate next.
Subsequently, we will discuss how the PD approach can be improved to serve as a useful measure of subjective mnemonic states in EC.


### Problematic assumptions of the PD approach and implications of their violation

In this section, we show how even small violations of the perfect-introspection assumption suffice to account for the EC-without-memory finding.
We then turn to two core assumptions---invariance and independence---that are common to all PD applications, and violations of which are problematic for both objective and subjective interpretations of the PD results.
In addressing these assumptions and the consequences of their violations, we illustrate that the PD findings obtained in the literature (most importantly, the *A*>0 finding) can be explained by single-process accounts and should not be interpreted as supportive of dual process models. 

#### Assumption 1: Perfect introspection

As we have just explained, the PD procedure assumes that introspective judgments are perfectly mapped onto objective memory states.
This assumption can be met only if memory follows an all-or-nothing (discrete-state) model, and introspection is perfectly accurate.
It is violated if memory is in fact continuous, or if it is all-or-none but introspection is not perfect.^[
Only if mnemonic states are discrete, it is at least possible that a participant can perfectly distinguish, introspectively, between the two states, as the PD model assumes.
If, however, the underlying mnemonic strength is continuous rather than discrete, then there will necessarily be some amount of overlap of strength distributions between memory-present and memory-absent states, such that it will not be possible to place a criterion that perfectly separates memory-present cases from memory-absent cases.
This implies that introspection of mnemonic states must be less than perfect, and that there will be some proportion of introspective misses in which there is (objectively) some amount of memory which the participant fails to detect.]
Leaving aside the discrete-state assumption (which is beyond the scope of the present research), 
it is a truism that introspection sometimes fails us.
<!-- there is ample reason to believe that introspection sometimes fails us (e.g., Nisbett; TODO: metacognition refs): -->
<!-- With regard to introspection about mnemonic states, p -->
In particular, as we stated above, participants sometimes fail to notice that they have memory for an event (*introspective miss*); conversely, they sometimes falsely experience "remembering" events they never experienced (*introspective false alarm*).


<!-- #### Consequences of introspective errors -->

<!-- In line with the literature, we deem it unlikely that the strong assumption of perfect introspection holds. -->
<!-- If perfect introspection fails, cases of introspective misalignment will occur (regardless of the true underlying memory model, discrete or continuous). -->
Of these cases of misalignment, introspective misses are most relevant here: If participants fail to detect the presence of memory in a PD trial, they will engage in the attitude judgment task (i.e., express their attitude, or revert their attitudinal responses under exclusion conditions).
<!--Assuming for a moment that evaluative and mnemonic judgments are based on the same memory trace (as would be predicted by continuous single-process accounts), then participants will tend to express a memory-consistent attitude under inclusion instructions and a memory-inconsistent attitude under exclusion instructions.-->
Despite the fact that memory is in fact present (but introspectively undetected), this will result in a response pattern identical to that predicted by the EC-without-memory process represented by the PD model's *A* parameter:
When analysed using the PD model, introspective misses will therefore inflate estimates of the A parameter, falsely suggesting the presence of memory-independent EC.
Cases of introspectively undetected memory will thus produce a result that is misinterpreted by the PD model as reflecting unconsciously learned attitudes.

This is supported by simulations in which data is generated from a simple "single-process" PD model, obtained by restricting $A=0$ but allowing for introspective errors, and then fitted with the PD model (which does not restrict A but assumes perfect introspection). 
For example, data generated from the single-process model with $M=.5$ and 10% introspective errors, when fitted with the full PD model, yields an estimate of $A=.09$ (comparable to the meta-analytic estimate of *A*=.07).

Even if introspective misses occur in only a small proportion of cases, this would suffice to seriously bias the estimate of the *A* parameter, and hence, pose serious threats to the validity and usefulness of the PD approach.
The above reanalysis of PD studies showed that the estimate of the *A* parameter is typically in the range of .04 to .11 [@mierop_does_2018].
With estimates of *M* typically varying around .5, the approximate proportion of cases governed by the relevant $(1-M)A$ branch of the model is between $.5*.04=.02$ and $.5*.11=.055$ (i.e., 2-6%).
In typical studies with 24 CSs, this corresponds to approximately 1 (i.e., between 0.5 and 1.3) CS per participant being governed by the $(1-M)A$ branch.
<!--In typical studies with 24 CSs, this translates to between $.02*24=0.48$ and $.055*24=1.32$ (i.e., about 1) CSs per participant.-->
In other words, the findings that have been interpreted as evidence for "EC-without-memory" in PD studies rely on approximately one response per participant.
Considering the results of the above simulation, a single-process memory model can explain these findings by allowing for, on average, one introspective miss per participant.


<!-- ### Methodological limitation 2: Discrete memory states -->

<!-- <!-- #### Assumption 2: Discrete memory states --> 

<!-- As briefly noted above, the PD method assumes memory to be in one of two discrete latent states: Explicit memory is either present (with probability m), or it is absent (with probability 1-m). -->
<!-- This discrete-state assumption is shared by the class of so-called threshold models (@yonelinas, @2ht, @2htsm, @kellen_ignored_2016). -->
<!-- Most current memory models, however, belong to the signal-detection framework and assume a continuous latent memory strength dimension (@sdt; for a critical test see @kellen_klauer_2014). -->
<!-- Signal-detection models typically assume that this memory strength signal is normally distributed with mean zero for noise trials (new items). -->
<!-- Presentation of an item during learning increases its memory strength by a variable amount, and this leads to a shift (i.e., increase in average memory strength) as well as a spread (i.e., increase in variability) of the normal distribution for signal trials (target items). -->
<!-- Both distributions overlap to some degree, so that memory strength of some new items exceeds that of the weakest target items. -->
<!-- In a memory test, the observer places a criterion somewhere along the memory strength axis (e.g., at the point of equal density of both distributions) to make a decision about whether to call an item "old" (if its strength exceeds the criterion value) or "new" (if strength falls below criterion). -->
<!-- Due to the overlap between distributions, some of these decisions will necessarily be incorrect: -->
<!-- The model predicts that there will be cases in which memory is absent, but a participant falsely *detects* having memory (i.e., false alarms: new items that exceed the criterion are called "old"); and there will be cases in which memory is present, but the participant fails to detect it (i.e., misses: target items whose memory strength falls below the criterion are called "new"). -->
<!-- The proportion of such errors is determined by the criterion value as well as the degree of distributional overlap (determined, e.g., by the strength of the memory manipulation). -->
<!-- ^[Recent work shows that the competing low-threshold model @kellen_ignored_2016 fares comparably well; for the present purposes, it makes the same predictions, namely that the presence of memory is erroneously detected in a certain proportion $q_n$ of new items; and that the absence of memory is erroneously detected for a proportion of $1-q_s$ old items. Note that the model does not necessarily assume that memory strength is equal and indistinguishable for all cases detected as *old* (nor for the items detected as *new*; see @luce_threshold_1963, p.64).] -->

<!-- In a typical EC experiment (such as those using the PD approach), "old" items are the CSs that were presented in the learning phase together with USs, and memory strength will typically not be identical for all "old" items (i.e., it will be stronger for some items and weaker for others). -->
<!-- The critical issue is whether memory strength varies continuously (as the SDT model assumes), or whether there are two distinct states (of "memory-present" vs. "memory-absent") as the PD model assumes. -->
<!-- Only in the latter case, in which mnemonic states are discrete, it is at least possible that a participant can perfectly distinguish, introspectively, between the two states, as the PD model further assumes. -->
<!-- If, however, the underlying mnemonic strength is continuous rather than discrete, then there will necessarily be some amount of overlap of strength distributions between memory-present and memory-absent states, such that it will not be possible to place a criterion that perfectly separates memory-present cases from memory-absent cases. -->
<!-- This implies that introspection of mnemonic states must be less than perfect, and that there will be some proportion of introspective misses in which there is (objectively) some amount of memory which the participant fails to detect. -->
<!-- The consequences of such introspective misses would again be the same as illustrated above. -->

<!-- OC: redundant -->
Summarizing briefly, the interpretation of the *A* parameter as reflecting EC without memory hinges on the existence of two discrete mnemonic states (memory present vs. absent) as well as the assumption of perfect introspective classification ability (i.e., all cases---and only those cases---in which memory is present are introspectively identified as *remember* experiences).
If either assumption fails, then there will be cases of misalignment between mnemonic states and introspective decisions.
These misalignments are not accounted for by the PD model, and they can lead to severe distortion of parameter estimates.
In particular, introspective misses are falsely interpreted as EC without memory, and this observation threatens the interpretation of PD findings as evidence for dual learning processes.


#### Assumption 2: Invariance


A core assumption of the PD approach relates to the invariance of cognitive processes across the two instruction conditions. 
As explained above, inclusion versus exclusion instruction conditions are realized in the PD procedure to disentangle the contribution of two distinct processes---memory versus EC in the absence of memory. 
The data-analytic model assumes that these two processes (and their corresponding model parameters *M* and *A*) are *invariant* across (i.e., the same under both) conditions: 
PD instructions affect only the direction of their effects, while the magnitudes of their contributions are unaffected. 
<!-- To justify equating the M and A parameters across inclusion and exclusion equations, it is assumed that the psychological processes they signify (memory as well as attitude in the absence of memory) are *invariant* across the two instruction conditions.  -->
Without equating parameters across conditions, the model would contain too many free parameters, and it would not be possible to obtain unique estimates of them [unless the design is expanded; e.g., @klauer_invariance_2015].

There is some evidence already in the original paper suggesting that the invariance assumption may be violated: 
In a pilot test of a within-participant PD variant, the inclusion and exclusion instructions were administered to the same participants successively. 
However, strong carry-over effects were found that led to model misfit and invalidated the within-participant approach. 
In the original paper, the carry-over effects were interpreted as alterations of the nature of the subsequent second task as a consequence of having performed the first task [@hutter_dissociating_2012]. 
This may be taken to indicate that the cognitive processes required under one instruction condition turned out incompatible with those required under the other instruction (i.e., that processes differed across conditions).

A potential difference between instructions that may explain such violations lies in the complexity of response mapping rules, which can be simplified under inclusion but not under exclusion instructions and may therefore exert a larger working memory load under the latter. 
As a consequence, the inclusion instruction may be easier for participants than exclusion; 
this may, for instance, cause response criteria (i.e., the amount of evidence that is required before a decision is made) or performance (accuracy and/or RT) to differ between inclusion and exclusion [@dehouwer_differences_1997].
In support of this possibility, a reanalysis of five studies in which we used the original PD procedure [@mierop_does_2018; @mierop_resource_2017] showed that RT robustly differed between inclusion and exclusion conditions (all *p* <.001; smallest *t* = 3.19; smallest Cohen's *d* = .64; smallest Bayes Factor in favor of a RT difference = 17). 
Another potential difference may lie in the degree to which retrieval processes in the two states are analytic versus holistic/nonanalytic [e.g., @whittlesea_implicit_2001. 
Differences in cognitive processing between inclusion and exclusion have the potential of distorting parameter estimates and invalidating substantial conclusions. 
Invariance violations have been empirically demonstrated in many other paradigms [@barth_assumptions_2019; @klauer_invariance_2015] and must be considered a realistic threat to the validity of the PD procedure.


#### Assumption 3: Independence

A final assumption of the data-analytic model underlying the PD approach is that of homogeneous (i.e., identically distributed) and independent cognitive processes across persons and items.
This *homogeneity/independence* assumption, which is required to justify the necessary data aggregation, states that the latent parameters are uncorrelated and similar for the different levels (items and/or persons).
<!--If the homogeneity assumption is not met, the aggregation across participants and items can lead to biases affecting parameter estimates as well as the results of statistical tests (e.g., Klauer, 2010).-->
The assumption has been found to be violated in comparable cases, and the consequences of these violations have been shown to include distorted parameter estimates [e.g., @curran_violations_1995; @curran_consequences_1997].
A violation can also bias the results of statistical tests [e.g., @klauer_hierarchical_2010]. 
For instance, it may lead to inflated alpha error rates in statistical tests of the model parameters (e.g., whether A is in fact different from zero).

The fact that the PD approach requires a between-participant manipulation of inclusion
versus exclusion instructions implies that it must assume homogeneity not only across items (an assumption which can sometimes be ensured via strict control of materials) but also across (groups of) persons (an assumption that is virtually always found to be violated).
But even if assumptions are indeed met, and group-level parameter estimates, as well as statistical tests, are unbiased, such group-level aggregates are often less informative than are more fine-grained estimates. 
For instance, @pleyers_aware_2007 have shown that awareness cannot be meaningfully assessed at the person level; instead, awareness is a property that refers to a specific person-item combination (i.e., a specific person being aware of a specific item or pairing) and should be analyzed as such.
The group-level aggregate results of the PD approach are limited in that they cannot be fruitfully related to other measures obtained at the person, item, or person-item-combination level (which we will call *response-level* hereafter), thereby considerably constraining the possibility of validating the PD's estimates and of facilitating future discovery.

### First interim summary

<!-- To summarize the previous section, w -->
The PD approach to EC relies on subjective mnemonic judgments.
If the results are to be meaningfully interpreted in terms of objective memory, the strong assumption of (discrete-state memory and) perfect introspection must hold.
Even small violations are sufficient to invalidate the EC-without-memory finding.
We conclude that the PD is unlikely to provide a valid and unbiased assessment of the role of objective memory in EC; 
yet, the subjective approach it has introduced may prove useful for EC research.
<!-- yet, it may prove useful for assessing the role of subjective mnemonic states in EC. -->
<!-- However, we have also discussed two problematic assumptions at the core of the PD procedure that limit its usefulness even if interpreted as a subjective measure. -->
Below we propose a procedural modification addressing some of these limitations and improving assessment of subjective mnemonic experiences in EC; the modified PD.




# II. Introducing a modified PD procedure to overcome limitations of the original PD approach

To overcome the above limitations, we take two steps towards a fine-grained measurement of (subjective and objective) memory and attitudes in EC research.
In a first step, we propose a modification of the PD procedure and explain how it allows improving assessment of subjective mnemonic experiences.
Specifically, we suggest recording participants' introspective decisions at the level of the individual response (i.e., person-item combination).
We introduce a minimal modification of the PD procedure that addresses the above limitations and yields a fine-grained response-level assessment of the role of mnemonic experiences in EC.
We then use this procedure to test core assumptions of the PD approach.

In a second step, we leverage the fact that our modified procedure is an instantation of a more general approach of response-level assessments of subjective awareness, and sketch how the modified procedure's remaining limitations can be alleviated by relying on established methods from the learning and memory literatures.
<!-- OC: redundant -->
Going beyond the original PD, we propose to separately assess objective and subjective memory states (instead of using subjective experiences as proxy for objective memory states), using response-level measures and simpler procedures (i.e., requiring neither two groups with different instructions nor multinomial models for data analysis).
Measuring subjective states at the response level is arguably more appropriate for the awareness issue, which is about *a given person's* awareness *of a specific item content*.
It is also beneficial from a methodological perspective because doing so obviates the problematic invariance and independence assumptions.
This general approach is analogous to subjective awareness assessments used, e.g., in implicit learning [@dienes_subjective_2007;@dienes_measuring_2005] and recognition memory [@gardiner_experiences_1998]. 

Next we introduce a version of this general approach that is as similar as possible to the PD procedure, which we have implemented in two experiments reported below to assess PD's core assumptions.
We then discuss the various advantages of the more general approach it represents.

### Step 1: Making introspective decisions observable - the modified PD procedure and its assets

The most severely limiting factor of the original PD approach is that it provides a group-level estimate (of EC in the absence of memory), instead of person-, item-, or response-level measures.
This is because the procedure conflates memory and attitude judgments by mapping both onto the same response (Figure\ \@ref(fig:pd-procedure-diagram)A).
Although participants are instructed to decide whether they remember the US valence or not, the outcome of this decision is made covertly and thus cannot be observed: 
On any given trial the “pleasant” or “unpleasant” response could reflect either a memory judgment or an attitude judgment; the researcher has no way of knowing which. 
The mapping of both judgments onto the same response effectively turns the---in-principle observable and verifiable---memory decision into a latent variable.
Only by aggregating the data---first across items, then across participants, separately for each instruction condition---and then relying on the estimates provided by the MPT model equations do we obtain a (rather indirect and coarse) group-level estimate of the proportion of responses that reflect an attitude in the absence of US valence memory.

(ref:pd-procedure-diagram) Schematic comparison of the two-stage tasks in the original process dissociation (PD) procedure (**A**) and our minimally modified PD procedure (**B**) under inclusion instructions.
In both procedures, participants first introspect whether they remember US valence or not.
If they do remember US valence, they report their memory judgment; if they do not remember US valence, they report an attitude judgment.
While the decision to report either a memory or attitude judgment remains unobserved in the original procedure it is observed as the choice between Memory and Attitude button sets in our modified procedure.
Rounded boxes with dashed lines represent unobservable and those with solid  lines observed task components.

```

We introduce a minimal modification of the procedure---more specifically, of the response-mapping rule---that removes this limitation and renders participants' introspective decision observable.
The modification is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:modPD) and Figure\ \@ref(fig:pd-procedure-diagram)B:
We introduce a second set of "pleasant"/"unpleasant" buttons, and we designated one for memory judgments and the other for attitude judgments.
Whenever participants decide that they remember US valence, they are instructed to use the Memory response buttons (in the upper half of the screen) to report the outcome of their subsequent memory judgment.
If they decide that they do not remember, they are instructed to use the Attitude response buttons (in the lower half of the screen) to report the outcome of their subsequent attitude judgment.
Thus, participants communicate their introspective decisions in an indirect and unobstrusive way by their use of the Memory or Attitude button set.


(ref:modPD) The modification introduces a second set of response buttons. Participants still engage in the two-stage task (i.e., they first determine whether they remember US valence or not; then they report a memory judgment if they remember, or an attitude judgment if they don't).
The critical difference is that participants report the memory judgment using the Memory buttons (top), and the attitude judgment using the Attitude buttons (bottom), thus rendering their introspective decision observable.
 

```{r modPD, fig.cap="(ref:modPD)", fig.env = "figure*", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/figure2_suggestion.jpg")
```

The new procedure introduces a minimal modification of an auxiliary part (i.e., response mapping) of the original PD procedure. 
It is similar to the original procedure in most respects:
It prescribes the same two-stage decision procedure, consisting of an initial introspective memory decision, the outcome of which determines whether a memory or attitude judgment is required in the second stage; and it specifies a mapping of response category (*pleasant* versus *unpleasant*) onto physical response (keyboard or mouse buttons) that varies depending on the outcome of the first-step introspective decision.
It differs from the original procedure only with regard to the mapping of response categories to response buttons: 
The original procedure requires participants to select either the standard response mapping (under inclusion conditions, or in case of a memory judgment under the attitude-exclusion condition) 
<!-- FN: or in case of an attitude judgment under the memory-exclusion condition)  -->
or the reversed response mapping (in case of an attitude judgment under the attitude-exclusion condition).
<!-- ; FN: or in case of a memory judgment under the memory-exclusion condition, see original paper). -->
In contrast, the modified procedure always uses the standard response mapping and simply requires participants to select either the Memory buttons (in case of a memory judgment) or the Attitude buttons (in case of an attitude judgment).
^[It might be argued that the modified response-mapping rules are not only unproblematic, but that they in fact represent an improvement in that they render the response mappings of both judgments more comparable: In the original PD, the standard mapping was required in 3 out of 4 cases; it might thereby have obtained the status of a habitual default, against which an active choice was required in the 4th case (i.e., absence of memory experience under Exclusion instructions). In the modified procedure, such a default is absent; it distinguished two cases of comparable status.]

### The assets of the modified PD

The proposed minor procedural modification renders introspective decisions observable at the response level. 
We will next address the consequences of this change in light of the limitations discussed above.

#### Interpretation in terms of subjective memory states

As stated above, the modification explicitly aims at assessing introspective mnemonic states.
The resulting responses are interpreted solely at the subjective level: 
A decision to use the Memory responses indicates a subjective state of ‘remembering’, whereas using the Attitude responses indicates a subjective state of ‘not remembering’.
In contrast to the original PD, these subjective assessments are not interpreted as reflecting objective memory.
Therefore, the assumptions made by the original PD approach that would allow for perfect alignment between subjective and objective memory states (i.e., discrete-state memory and perfect introspection) are no longer required.

#### Procedural and analytic simplification

In the modified procedure, a participant's subjective mnemonic decision about a given item is observable: 
It is recorded whether the Memory or Attitude responses were used.
<!-- In contrast to the original PD, this information is directly available and does not need to be indirectly inferred via the model-based joint analysis of data from the inclusion and exclusion conditions. -->
Because the mnemonic decision is observable, it is no longer necessary to infer it indirectly from parameter estimates of an MPT model.

<!-- This simplifies the data analysis (and associated assumptions): -->
Without the need for the MPT model, the assessment procedure can be simplified: 
Because it is no longer necessary to contrast the inclusion versus exclusion response patterns, the between-subject instruction manipulation can be omitted. 
This makes the modified procedure more efficient and flexible. 
For example, it can be used in within-participant designs that allow for more stringent experimental control as well as higher statistical power.

Omitting the between-subjects instruction manipulation further simplifies data analysis and associated assumptions:
First, without the different instruction conditions, the invariance assumption is no longer needed.
Second, because there is no need to aggregate responses across items and persons, the homogeneity/independence assumption is no longer needed.
Hence, the proposed minor modification allows for much less assumption-laden data analysis.

#### Benefits of response-level assessment

A critical advantage of the modified procedure is that it assesses,
<!-- The modification yields item-level data about participants' introspective "remember" decision:  We know -->
for each item, whether a given participant based their response on a "remember" experience or not.
This newly available information enables more fine-grained analyses and rigorous tests.
First, EC effects can be scrutinized at the item-within-person instead of the group level.
Hence, our modification follows the recommendation that awareness in EC needs to be assessed for each CS, not at the participant or group levels [@pleyers_aware_2007].

<!--#### Testing assumptions of the original PD (introspective acc., invariance)-->

Second, the data can be fruitfully related to the outcomes of other measures obtained from the same participant, for instance to
<!-- outcomes of the PD's memory and attitude judgments (e.g., for testing the PD's assumption of introspective accuracy), or to -->
additionally administrated evaluative (e.g., evaluative ratings, evaluative priming effects) or (objective) memory measures (e.g., of US valence and US identity).
For instance, observable mnemonic decisions at the item level can help to empirically assess the validity of the assumptions underlying the original PD procedure:
<!-- The data can be related to the outcomes from the PD two-step task's second-level judgments on an item-by-item level. -->
Subjective mnemonic decisions can be related to objective memory measures to assess introspective accuracy (i.e., the proportion of "remember" cases in which correct US valence memory was present).
<!-- This allows using the modified procedure to probe introspective accuracy in the PD two-step task. -->
<!-- Although some studies have addressed participants' cognitions about the introspective basis of their responses in valence-memory tasks (@bar-anan), so far we know of no studies addressing introspection in the PD procedure. -->
This way, the modification allows us to assess the accuracy of participants' introspection.

<!--#### Addressing novel research questions-->

Relating response-level responses to other measures allows for investigating a wide range of EC-related research questions:
<!--(e.g., regarding the level of US identity or source memory; correlations between memory and EC; negative-EC effects indicative of the affect-as-information artefact; or factors suspected of affecting mnemonic experiences such as valence and arousal).-->
<!-- The fact that subjective mnemonic states are indicated for manifest subsets of the data (i.e., individual items within a person) allows for analyzing these identified subsets further to determine whether they reflect the operation of qualitatively distinct processes. -->
Interesting questions regarding the correlation between subjective and objective memory states and EC are, for example, whether EC is related to the vivid recollection of pairings and/or to the successful retrieval of source details.
Conversely, one can address the question whether subjective "remember" judgments (and/or accurate memory) are related to stimulus evaluations.
They may also inform the conditions under which certain introspective heuristics or biases are used (e.g., whether the attitude-as-information artifact reflects a heuristic used under uncertainty or a memory distortion).
More generally, response-level measures can be related to other person-level (e.g., surveillance accuracy, working memory, need-to-evaluate), item properties (e.g., valence, salience norms), as well as response-level measures (e.g., pre-and post-experimental CS evaluations, ratings of evocativeness, objective measures of US memory).
Combining information in this way across different outcome dimensions can yield richer result patterns that are more informative for comparisons of single- versus dual-process models than the group-level A>0 result:
For instance, researchers can probe whether learning effects associated with CSs in different states of (subjective) awareness do indeed show qualitatively different result patterns [i.e., crossed double dissociations, two-dimensional state-trace patterns; @dunn_discovering_1988; @dunn_remember-know_2004; @schmidt_criteria_2006] as they are postulated by dual-process models of attitude learning [@gawronski_implicit_2014;@jones_implicit_2009; @sweldens_evaluative_2010].

### Step 2: Going beyond (modified) PD: Using established measures of subjective memory states

There are also limitations of the minimally modified PD procedure, implying that it may not be an equally well-suited tool for all research goals:
First, it has not yet been empirically validated (a limitation that will be addressed by the two experiments reported below).
Second, it provides a relatively crude binary subjective assessment: 
It distinguishes between only two mnemonic states (i.e., the presence versus absence of *remember* experiences).
Third, because the to-be-performed judgment depends on the subjective state, it provides only partial information about the relation between memory and attitudes:
Memory reports are obtained only in case of an introspective "remember" decision, whereas attitude reports are obtained only in the absence of such decisions.
The latter two constraints are inherent in the assessment procedure; unless the close comparability to the original PD is critical (as in the present study), researchers are therefore advised to consider using different measures.
Established measures of mnemonic awareness without these limitations are readily available, including confidence judgments and the remember-know task which are widely used in consciousness and memory research [e.g., see @dienes_subjective_2007; @dunn_remember-know_2004; @gardiner_experiences_1998].
Our second study will illustrate how these measures may be fruitfully applied in EC research.

<!-- The item-level measures also allows for investigating new possible research questions: -->
<!-- Interesting issues include investigating whether the affect-as-information heuristic proposed by Hütter et al. is indeed used in cases of uncertainty (i.e., when participants are uncertain about their memory), or whether its use is associated with strong mnemonic experiences (i.e., more similar to false-memory phenomena); whether better-remembered stimuli are more likely to show EC; or whether more extremely valent stimuli are more likely to be (objectively or subjectively) remembered. -->

<!-- More generally, item-level measures can be related to other person-level (e.g., surveillance accuracy, working memory, need to evaluate) and/or (person-by-)item-level measures (e.g., pre-and post-experimental CS evaluations, ratings of evocativeness or salience, objective measures of US memory). -->
<!-- Combining information across different outcome dimensions can yield informative patterns that can then be used to compare single- versus dual-process models (e.g., the 2D state-trace analysis example by Vorberg & Schmidt). -->

### Second interim summary

By implementing a simple procedural modification---namely, asking participants to use different response-button sets depending on their subjective memory---the modified PD allows for a more fine-grained assessment than the original PD approach, and at the same time it comes without some of the latter's unrealistic assumptions. 
It (1) enables an observable tracking of the subjective memory decision, (2) provides a response-level measure of memory states, which further allows relating memory states to variables both at the person-level and at the item-level; and (3) removes the need of the exclusion condition, allowing for increasing statistical power and discarding the invariance and independence assumptions.

<!-- Summing up, the present work has three goals: -->
<!-- First, we introduce and test an observation-level subjective assessment of memory in EC to address limitations of the original PD approach. -->
<!-- Second, we use the modified procedure to empirically investigate core assumptions underlying the original PD. -->
<!-- Third, we show how the specific approach introduced here can be fruitfully superceded by subjective measures established in the consciousness and memory literatures, and we sketch how this may benefit EC research. -->

<!-- We report two experiments that aim at validating the modified approach and testing PD assumptions. -->
<!-- Both studies assessed the validity of the modified procedure and tested the perfect-introspection and invariance assumptions of the original procedure. -->
<!-- In Experiment 2, we complement the modified PD procedure with established observation-level subjective memory measures and illustrate their potential usefulness for EC research. -->

# III. Empirical section

Now that we have discussed the original PD and the advantage of the modified PD, we report two experiments that were designed to address three main goals.
The first goal was to test the validity of our modified PD (Experiment 1 and 2). 
The second goal was to use the modified procedure to empirically investigate core assumptions underlying the original PD (Experiments 1 and 2). 
The third goal was to examine how the response-level subjective assessment of memory approach introduced here can be fruitfully complemented by subjective memory measures established in the consciousness and memory literatures (see section "Exploring the potential of response-level subjective memory measures in EC research”).
